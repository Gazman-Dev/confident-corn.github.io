Rudolph Isley claims that his brother Ronald Isley has trademarked 'The Isley Brothers' without his consent and is taking all the profits. Rudolph says that they are supposed to split all profits from the band 50/50, but Ronald recently went rogue. Ronald applied for and was granted the exclusive rights to 'The Isley Brothers' for use on 'visual recordings and audiovisual recordings featuring music and animation' back in August, but Rudolph says Ronald needs his approval to cut such a deal. Rudolph wants the court to declare that the trademark is jointly owned by him and his brother and wants Ronald to cough up half of any money he's been making off their band's good name since getting the trademark.
