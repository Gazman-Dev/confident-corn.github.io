Six years after Alexis Bledel reprised her role on the show's Netflix revival, fans have been left hanging over her character's pregnancy. Valerie revealed in a TikTok video that fans just had to 'do the math' of Rory's pregnancy timeline in order to figure out the identity of her baby's dad. According to Valerie, Rory wasn't sleeping with Paul (Jack Carpenter) during winter since they weren't really dating at that time. Meanwhile, Rory's one night stand with a man dressed as a Wookiee happened in the spring season, meaning she would’ve been visibly showing a baby bump by the fall season when she revealed her pregnancy to Lorelai (Lauren Graham). Valerie noted that Rory was never given a pregnancy belly and they were never instructed to give her one. Therefore, she confirmed that the Wookiee was definitely not the father.
