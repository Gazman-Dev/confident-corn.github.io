## What factors contribute to the volatility of stock prices?
Several factors contribute to the volatility of stock prices. One major factor is market sentiment, which can be influenced by economic indicators, geopolitical events, and investor psychology. Positive news or events can drive stock prices higher, while negative news or events can cause them to decline. Additionally, company-specific factors such as earnings reports, product launches, and management changes can also impact stock prices. Another factor is market speculation and trading activity. The buying and selling decisions of investors, including institutional investors and traders, can create price fluctuations. Lastly, external factors such as government policies, interest rates, and global economic conditions can play a role in stock market volatility.

## How do news-based prediction models compare to traditional models in terms of accuracy?
News-based prediction models and traditional models differ in their approach and sources of information. News-based prediction models rely on real-time news articles, social media posts, and other news sources to analyze sentiment and extract relevant information. These models use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to predict stock price movements based on the impact of news events. On the other hand, traditional models typically rely on historical price and volume data, as well as financial indicators, to make predictions. While news-based prediction models can capture the immediate impact of news events, traditional models take a more systematic and data-driven approach. In terms of accuracy, the performance of these models can vary depending on the market conditions and the quality of the data used. Both types of models have their strengths and limitations, and it is important to consider multiple factors when evaluating their accuracy.

## How are US-China trade tensions impacting the global economy?
The US-China trade tensions have significant implications for the global economy. The trade dispute between the two largest economies in the world has led to increased tariffs, import restrictions, and other trade barriers. These measures have disrupted global supply chains, increased costs for businesses, and affected consumer prices. US companies that rely on Chinese imports or have a presence in China have faced challenges in their operations and supply chains. On the other hand, Chinese companies exporting to the US have been impacted by reduced demand and higher costs. The trade tensions have also created uncertainty for businesses and investors, leading to volatility in financial markets. Beyond the direct economic impact, the trade tensions have broader implications for the global trading system and the geopolitical landscape. It has raised concerns about the future of free trade and multilateral cooperation, and has the potential to reshape global economic relationships and alliances.
