## What are the requirements for conviction and removal from office in an impeachment trial?
In an impeachment trial, the requirements for conviction and removal from office are quite strict. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required for conviction, which means that at least 67 out of the 100 Senators must vote in favor of conviction. This high threshold emphasizes the seriousness of the process and ensures that it is not easily used for political purposes. Additionally, the House of Representatives charges an official by approving articles of impeachment, which serves as the basis for the trial. The Senate then acts as a High Court of Impeachment, where evidence is considered, witnesses are heard, and a vote is taken to either acquit or convict the impeached official. It is important to note that the penalty for an impeached official upon conviction is removal from office, which effectively ends their tenure and disqualifies them from holding public office in the future.

## What is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's position on convicting President Donald Trump?
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's position on convicting President Donald Trump in the upcoming Senate impeachment trial is currently uncertain. While McConnell has not made a final decision on how he will vote, he has expressed that he will listen to the legal arguments presented to the Senate. McConnell has previously disapproved of the first impeachment of President Trump, but he has not ruled out the possibility of voting to convict him this time. McConnell's dissatisfaction with Trump's actions leading up to the Capitol riot and his desire to distance the Republican party from Trump may influence his decision. However, McConnell has also suggested that it might be best to wait until after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office before holding the Senate trial. This uncertainty regarding McConnell's position adds an intriguing element to the upcoming trial and raises questions about the potential impact on Trump's political future and the dynamics within the Republican party.

## How does Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualify public officials from holding office?
Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualifies public officials from holding office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States government. This disqualification applies to individuals who swore an oath to support the Constitution as federal or state officers and then participated in acts of insurrection or rebellion. The disqualification remains unless Congress removes it by a two-thirds vote. This provision was originally included in the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War to safeguard American democracy from those who sought to destroy it. Adjudications under Section 3 have occurred throughout history, with at least eight public officials being disqualified from holding office. Notably, a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified under Section 3. Engaging in insurrection does not necessarily involve direct acts of violence, as demonstrated by cases where individuals knowingly and voluntarily aided violent insurrections without personally committing violent acts. The recent events on January 6th have brought renewed attention to Section 3 and its potential implications for public officials involved in the Capitol riot.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<h2>Impeachment Process in the United States Constitution</h2>
<p>The House of Representatives has the sole power of impeachment, while the Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments. No person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.</p>
<p>Impeachment is a fundamental component of the system of checks and balances. Congress charges and then tries an official of the federal government for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The definition of high crimes and misdemeanors is debated.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives charges an official of the federal government by approving articles of impeachment. The Senate sits as a High Court of Impeachment to consider evidence, hear witnesses, and vote to acquit or convict the impeached official. A committee of representatives, called managers, act as prosecutors before the Senate. In presidential impeachment trials, the chief justice of the United States presides.</p>
<p>A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required for conviction. The penalty for an impeached official upon conviction is removal from office. The Senate can also disqualify impeached officials from holding public office in the future. There is no appeal. About half of Senate impeachment trials since 1789 have resulted in conviction and removal from office.</p>
<h2>McConnell's Position on Trump's Conviction</h2>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled out voting to convict President Donald Trump in an upcoming Senate impeachment trial. McConnell stated that he has not made a final decision on how he will vote and intends to listen to the legal arguments presented to the Senate. McConnell has expressed that he is pleased with the House's impeachment efforts.</p>
<p>The House passed an article of impeachment charging President Trump with 'incitement of insurrection' for his speech before the Capitol riot. McConnell disavowed the first impeachment effort of Trump. McConnell is furious with President Trump and suggested that impeachment might make it easier to purge the Republican party of Trump. McConnell believes it would be best for the country to wait until after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office to hold a Senate trial. The Senate is expected to reconvene on Jan. 19, the day before the inauguration. McConnell is seeking to avoid transmission of the articles of impeachment before Inauguration Day.</p>
<p>Democrats have urged McConnell to call the Senate back early for an emergency session to begin the trial. McConnell has no intention of altering the schedule and has refused to call the Senate back early. It will take the vote of two-thirds of the Senators to convict the President. It is unclear whether there will be enough Republican support to convict. Several GOP senators have expressed support for Trump's removal from office. Republicans have stated their concerns about the potential delays caused by a trial to Biden's legislative agenda. Biden has spoken with McConnell about the possibility of an agreement that would allow the Senate to continue work on his key priorities during the trial.</p>
<h2>Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment</h2>
<p>At least eight public officials have been formally adjudicated to be disqualified and barred from public office under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment since its ratification in 1868. Section 3, also known as the Disqualification Clause, has gained new relevance in the wake of the January 6th insurrection.</p>
<p>Adopted after the Civil War to protect American democracy from those who sought to destroy it, Section 3 disqualifies from office anyone who swore an oath to support the Constitution as a federal or state officer and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against it, unless Congress removes the disqualification by a two-thirds vote.</p>
<p>CREW analyzed historical records to identify all public officials who a court, legislature, or other body determined to have been disqualified under Section 3. The list includes six officials aligned with the Confederacy who held office after the Civil War, as well as former New Mexico County Commissioner Couy Griffin, who a state court removed from office last year based on his participation in the January 6th insurrection following a lawsuit CREW brought on behalf of three New Mexico residents.</p>
<p>Section 3 adjudications against former Confederates were rare in the aftermath of the Civil War. Former Confederates flooded Congress with thousands of amnesty requests to 'remove' their Section 3 disqualification. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified on July 9, 1868, and Congress removed the Section 3 disqualification for most ex-Confederates less than four years later in the Amnesty Act of May 22, 1872.</p>
<p>Historical precedent confirms that a criminal conviction is not required for an individual to be disqualified under Section 3. No one who has been formally disqualified under Section 3 was charged under the criminal 'rebellion or insurrection' statute. Section 3 is not a criminal penalty, but rather is a qualification for holding public office in the United States that can be and has been enforced through civil lawsuits in state courts, among other means. One can 'engage' in insurrection without personally committing violent acts. Neither Kenneth Worthy nor Couy Griffin were accused of engaging in violence, yet both were ruled to be disqualified because they knowingly and voluntarily aided violent insurrections.</p>
