Moving to a smaller market may result in a decrease in television revenue due to a smaller audience size and potentially lower advertising rates. However, the team's ownership is optimistic about the potential for growth in the Las Vegas market. Las Vegas is a city known for entertainment, and the relocation of the Athletics can attract new fans and generate interest in the team. Additionally, the team's move to a new, state-of-the-art stadium can enhance the fan experience and attract higher attendance, leading to increased revenue from ticket sales and concessions.
