![Introducing 'Burnt Hair' - a smoky and distinctive fragrance that has taken the world by storm! #ElonMusk #BoringCompany #Perfume](/assets/52c78377-74bd-42a3-aac1-1656d85726df.jpg "Elon Musk's Boring Company Launches 'Burnt Hair' Perfume")

Elon Musk's Boring Company recently made headlines with the launch of their latest product, a perfume called 'Burnt Hair'. This unique fragrance has captured the attention of consumers around the world, quickly selling out all 30,000 bottles.

The perfume, priced at $100, promises to deliver a scent that is unlike anything else on the market. Described as 'like leaning over a candle at the dinner table', 'Burnt Hair' is said to evoke a smoky and distinctive aroma.

The velvety black box and garish red bottle, with 'SINGED' printed at the bottom, add to the allure of this limited edition perfume. However, it is the reactions of those who have experienced the scent that truly capture the essence of 'Burnt Hair'.

Insider conducted a blind scent test with members of their newsroom, and the results were divided. Some staffers described the scent as smoky with notes of cigarettes, floral, burning cardboard, and stale cigarettes. It was compared to various scenarios, including an old lady in church, a wildfire in Colorado, and 20-something regret.

While some found the scent intriguing and alluring, others found it repugnant. A small percentage of staffers believed that the scent stayed true to its promise of repugnant desire.

In addition to its unique fragrance, 'Burnt Hair' also has an interesting backstory. The Boring Company, founded by Elon Musk as a solution to traffic congestion, has been known for its unconventional products. From flamethrowers to Tesla-branded short-shorts, Musk has a knack for capturing the attention and curiosity of the public.

However, the launch of 'Burnt Hair' took Musk's meme-mania to a new level. What started as a joke on Twitter quickly turned into a reality, with 30,000 bottles sold to eager customers. The perfume became a collector's item, showcasing the power of Musk's fan base.

As with any launch from Elon Musk, there is always a twist. Musk jokingly mentioned buying Twitter with the profits from the perfume sales, adding a touch of humor to the announcement. However, federal authorities are now investigating Musk in connection with the Twitter acquisition, adding a layer of complexity to the story.

Despite the controversy and investigation, there is no denying the impact of 'Burnt Hair'. As deliveries of the perfume begin, customers eagerly await the experience of this unique scent. Whether you love it or find it repulsive, 'Burnt Hair' is undeniably an attention-grabbing creation that further solidifies Elon Musk's reputation as a visionary entrepreneur.
