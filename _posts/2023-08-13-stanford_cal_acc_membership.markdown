## What are the potential consequences for Stanford and Cal if they are not able to join the ACC?
If Stanford and Cal are not able to join the ACC, there could be several potential consequences for both universities. Firstly, they may miss out on the financial benefits that come with being a member of the ACC. The ACC has reported record revenue, and by not joining the conference, Stanford and Cal would not have access to the increased revenue from the ACC Network. This could impact their ability to fund athletic programs and facilities, as well as potentially hinder their competitiveness in recruiting top athletes.

Secondly, not being able to join the ACC could limit the exposure and recognition that Stanford and Cal receive. The ACC is a well-established and highly regarded conference, and being a part of it would increase visibility for Stanford and Cal's athletic programs. This could have both short-term and long-term implications for their overall brand and reputation, as well as their ability to attract top-tier coaches, athletes, and even potential academic students.

Lastly, if Stanford and Cal are unable to join the ACC, it may lead to further uncertainty and speculation about the future of the Pac-12 Conference. There have already been predictions about teams leaving the Pac-12 for other conferences, and Stanford and Cal's exclusion from the ACC could potentially accelerate this trend. This could weaken the Pac-12's overall competitiveness and financial standing, as well as create instability in the conference as teams search for new homes.

## How might the ACC's decision on revenue allocation impact the future of the conference?
The ACC's decision on revenue allocation will likely have a significant impact on the future of the conference. The allocation of revenue can influence the distribution of resources among member schools, which in turn can affect their competitiveness and overall financial stability.

If the ACC decides to allocate revenue based on factors such as competitive success, television appeal, and academic performance, it could potentially create a more balanced and competitive conference. Schools that consistently perform well in sports and have high television ratings would be rewarded, which could incentivize other schools to improve their programs in order to receive a larger share of the revenue.

On the other hand, if the ACC chooses to disproportionately reward certain schools, such as Clemson and Florida State, it could lead to increased inequality within the conference. This could potentially create tensions and dissatisfaction among member schools that feel they are not receiving a fair share of the revenue. It may also impact the willingness of certain schools to remain in the ACC, as they may seek opportunities in conferences where the revenue distribution is more favorable to them.

Overall, the ACC's decision on revenue allocation will shape the financial landscape of the conference and could impact its long-term stability and competitiveness.

## What implications does this article have for the future of college conference realignment and expansion?
This article raises implications for the future of college conference realignment and expansion. The opposition faced by Stanford and Cal in their bid to join the ACC highlights the challenges and complexities involved in conference realignment. Even if there is vocal support from certain schools within a conference, it does not guarantee approval or smooth entry into a new conference.

This article also points to the potential for shifting conference affiliations among schools. The fact that schools like Florida State may consider leaving the ACC if there are no changes to revenue distribution indicates that schools are actively seeking the best financial opportunities and conference alignments for their programs.

Furthermore, the article raises questions about the financial value and marketability of certain schools when it comes to conference expansion. The debate over whether Stanford and Cal are a better fit for the ACC or the American Athletic Conference highlights the strategic decisions that conferences and schools need to make when considering expansion.

Overall, this article suggests that college conference realignment and expansion will continue to be a topic of interest and speculation in the future, as schools aim to position themselves in conferences that offer the best financial benefits, exposure, and competitive opportunities.
