OrderedDict([('title', 'Inclusion of WTI Midland in Brent Benchmark: Implications and Potential Risks'), ('content', "Brent crude, known as the most important number in the oil market, is undergoing a significant change. Platts, a leading price-reporting agency, is adding transactions of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland to the pool used to calculate the benchmark. This move marks the first time oil from outside the North Sea will be included in the Brent benchmark.\n\nThe inclusion of WTI Midland in the Brent benchmark has garnered attention and raised questions about the robustness of the benchmark and its potential implications for the oil market. The context provided by various articles highlights the key events surrounding this development.\n\n**Context: Brent Crude and the Benchmark**\n\nBrent crude has long been the primary reference point for pricing crude oil around the world. It serves as the benchmark for approximately two-thirds of the 100 million barrels of oil traded each day. However, in recent times, the transactions used to calculate the Brent crude price have become rarer, prompting the need for a solution.\n\n**Platts' Solution: Including WTI Midland in the Benchmark**\n\nAs a solution to the decreasing number of Brent transactions, Platts has decided to add transactions of WTI Midland to the pool used to calculate the benchmark. WTI Midland is a grade of crude oil that is similar to Brent and commonly used as a feedstock for European refineries.\n\n**Implications and Potential Risks**\n\nThe inclusion of WTI Midland in the Brent benchmark carries several implications for the oil market. On the positive side, it will provide additional volume to the benchmark, ensuring its continued robustness. It will also bring the influence of U.S. fundamentals to the Brent benchmark, making it more reflective of global market conditions.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the inclusion of Midland could overwhelm the benchmark and favor certain market makers. This raises questions about the potential for manipulation of the benchmark and the need for increased oversight and regulation.\n\nMoreover, the presence of WTI Midland could result in increased price volatility for Brent crude. The influx of WTI Midland could lead to changes in crude price arbitrage and the economics of buying and moving particular crudes. This, in turn, may impact hedging activities in the market.\n\n**Public Acceptance and Support**\n\nThe decision to include WTI Midland in the benchmark has received widespread support and interest from market participants. There have been record open interest in Midland and Houston contracts, indicating the industry's acceptance of this change.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe inclusion of WTI Midland in the Brent benchmark introduces a significant shift in the oil market. While it brings potential benefits such as increased liquidity and a more reflective benchmark, there are also potential risks associated with its inclusion. Platts, as the price-reporting agency, must ensure transparency, oversight, and robustness to maintain the integrity of the benchmark. The decision to include WTI Midland reflects changing market dynamics and the evolving nature of global crude oil pricing.")])
