## How will Stroman's injury impact the Chicago Cubs' chances of securing a playoff spot?
Stroman's injury will have a significant impact on the Chicago Cubs' chances of securing a playoff spot. Stroman was a key member of the Cubs' rotation, and his absence will leave a void in the pitching staff. His rough performances prior to the injury were a concern, but his experience and skillset still made him an important asset. Without Stroman, the Cubs will have to rely on other pitchers to step up and perform at a high level consistently. This puts added pressure on the remaining rotation members to carry the team and deliver strong performances. The Cubs' playoff aspirations will depend on how well the rest of the rotation can fill Stroman's shoes and maintain their performance levels throughout the season.

## What are the treatment options for bruised ribs and how long does it usually take to heal?
The treatment options for bruised ribs typically involve rest and restricted movement to allow the ribs to heal. Doctors may also recommend medication to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. Breathing techniques may be taught to manage any breathing difficulties caused by the injury. Rest and limited activity help reduce strain on the ribs, allowing them to heal properly. Ice packs can be applied to the injured area to help reduce swelling and ease discomfort. Pain medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can be prescribed to manage pain. In some cases, anesthetic injections may be administered to provide immediate relief. Additionally, respiratory therapy can aid in pain reduction and improve breathing. The healing time for bruised ribs is typically around a month, but if the ribs are broken, it may take longer for complete recovery.

## How has Javier Assad performed in the rotation and can he be a key player for the Cubs?
Javier Assad's performance in the rotation has been promising and he has the potential to be a key player for the Cubs. In his recent three-inning appearance against Team USA, Assad showcased his talent by striking out a batter and limiting a lineup that included multiple All-Stars and award winners to just one hit. This impressive performance has earned him praise from Cubs manager David Ross. Assad's ability to step up in high-pressure situations and deliver strong performances indicates that he has the potential to be a valuable asset for the team. As an under-the-radar player, Assad has the opportunity to make a significant impact on the Cubs' rotation. If he continues to display his skills and consistency, he could become a key contributor to the team's success throughout the season and potentially in the playoffs.
