*A woman in Texas was saved by a hawk after a snake fell from the sky and attacked her.*

In a heart-stopping incident in Silsbee, Texas, Peggy Jones was mowing her yard when a snake fell from the sky and landed on her arm. The snake quickly wrapped around her arm and struck at her face, leaving her terrified and defenseless. But just when it seemed like all hope was lost, an unexpected hero came to her rescue: a hawk.

The hawk swooped down and clawed at Peggy's arm in a brave attempt to remove the snake. With its powerful talons, the hawk managed to pry the snake off, saving Peggy from further harm. While she sustained cuts and bruises on her arm, Peggy firmly believes that the hawk saved her life.

This incident sheds light on the dangers of venomous snakes in the United States. According to recent studies, venomous snake bites are rare but can be fatal. Each year, an estimated 7,000-8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States, with approximately 5 deaths reported. It is crucial for employers to educate workers on their risk of exposure to venomous snakes and teach them how to prevent and protect themselves from snake bites.

Snake identification skills are also essential when encountering a snake. There are various types of snakes in the United States, including non-poisonous ones. It is important to be able to identify the different snake species to ensure personal safety. Pit vipers, such as rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths, are considered venomous and can cause severe harm if bitten.

Hawks, on the other hand, are well-known for their powerful hunting abilities. Some hawk species are specialized in hunting and killing snakes. Snakes are one of their favorite foods, and hawks can catch and eat snakes as long as 5 feet. Although not all hawk species are snake hunters, they are capable of catching and consuming snakes using their talons or beaks. However, hawks may sometimes get bitten by rattlesnakes and are known to prey on other snake species, including kingsnakes and baby pythons.

While hawk attacks on humans are rare, it is important to understand their behavior. Hawks prefer to stay away from humans and will only attack if they perceive a threat, such as when their nests or young are endangered. To avoid hawk attacks, it is advised to stay away from their nesting sites and be alert in areas where hawks are known to frequent. Hawks can also spread diseases and pests, such as avian tuberculosis and West Nile virus, so it is essential to take precautions when encountering them.

In this remarkable incident, Peggy Jones found herself in a life-threatening situation, only to be saved by a hawk. This story serves as a reminder of the unexpected heroes in nature and the need to respect and coexist with the wildlife around us.
