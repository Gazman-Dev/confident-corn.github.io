The stock market rally showed strong action this past week, as bank fears ebbed. Investors are turning their attention to electric vehicle (EV) companies, with Tesla (TSLA) and China's BYD (BYDDF), Nio (NIO), XPeng (XPEV) and Li Auto (LI) in focus over the weekend. 

Li Auto, XPeng and Nio reported their March and first-quarter sales on Saturday, and EV and battery giant BYD is due to release its sales figures this weekend as well. Tesla will release its first-quarter delivery and production figures, probably on Sunday. Analysts expect another record quarter for deliveries, thanks to hefty price cuts. 

Tesla deliveries for the first quarter should come in around 432,000, besting Q4's record 405,278 and up 39% vs. a year earlier. Big Tesla price cuts worldwide and new U.S. tax credits fueled demand. Li Auto reported March deliveries of 20,823 hybrid SUVs, up 89% vs. a year earlier. That's up 25% vs. 16,620 in February. Q1 sales totaled 52,584, at the lower end of its late February forecast of 52,000-55,000. March sales include the new L7, a five-seat electric SUV. 

Nio delivered 10,378 vehicles in March, up 3.9% vs. a year earlier but down nearly 15% vs. February's 12,157. That included 3,203 SUVs and 7,175 sedans. Q1 deliveries totaled 31,041, just above the low end of its target for 31,000-33,000 vehicles. XPeng deliveries came in at 7,002, plunging nearly 55% vs. a year earlier but up 16.5% vs. February's 6,010. P7 sedan sales grew 32% vs. February to 3,010, but didn't give a breakdown between the P7 and refreshed version, the P7i. Q1 deliveries were 18,230 vehicles, at the lower end of its guidance for 18,000-19,000. 

BYD should report improving sales in March vs. February. A Tesla-triggered price war and more-sluggish EV demand growth amid stepped-up production capacity is a challenge for automakers. BYD stock jumped 9.8% in the latest week to 29.40, building the right side of a new base with a 34.04 buy point. Shares reclaimed their 50-day line and finished just below their 200-day line. A decisive move above the 200-day could offer an early entry. 

LI stock has a double-bottom base with a 25.46 buy point that's just above the 200-day line. Shares climbed 6.7% to 24.95 last week but dipped 1.5% Friday as Li Auto hit resistance at the buy point and 200-day. XPEV stock leapt 15.5% last week and Nio stock nearly 16%. Both are above their 50-day lines but below their 200-day lines. 

The stock market rally started this past week sluggishly, but took a decisively bullish turn starting Wednesday, closing near weekly highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ran up 3.2% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index leapt 3.5%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 3.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 popped 3.85%. 

Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 3.4% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) charged up 4.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gained 3.4%. 

The Nasdaq powered above 12,000 and is closing in on the Feb. 2 high. The Nasdaq 100 has vaulted to its best levels since late August. The S&P 500, which reclaimed its 50-day line on Wednesday's FTD, continued to advance through Friday. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 200-day line during the week and moved above its 50-day line on Friday. The Russell 2000, which as recently as March 24 was hitting five-month lows, has reclaimed the 21-day line as bank stocks at least stabilized. 

The bank crisis appears to be waning. Fed rates are likely to peak well below what markets thought a month ago. That's a bullish combination, especially for growth stocks. Investors need to take advantage of the current environment. But build exposure up gradually, letting the market draw you in. It's not yet clear if this is the start of an extended market rally or just a short-lived advance. It's also possible that the major indexes will pause or pull back briefly. 

Don't buy extended stocks. And while investors could fill their portfolios with, say, only quality chip stocks, it's not wise to get too concentrated in particular sectors.
