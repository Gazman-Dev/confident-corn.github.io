# Dow Jones Futures Today

Investors are keeping a close eye on the futures market as the Dow Jones rose 0.1% versus fair value, while S&P 500 futures remained little changed. However, Nasdaq futures fell 0.2%. It's important to note that the markets in Hong Kong and Europe were closed for Easter Monday, so overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

# Jobs Report

The Labor Department recently released the latest job report, and the numbers are a mixed bag. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000, just below the estimated 240,000. Private payrolls only rose by 189,000, which is well below what analysts expected at 223,000. Manufacturing jobs also unexpectedly dipped by 1,000. However, the jobless rate dipped to 3.5%, back to long-term lows. Hourly earnings rose by 0.3% versus February, which was in line with expectations. Despite the slower wage gains and private hiring, the odds of a Fed rate hike in May jumped to 67% on Thursday from 49% on Wednesday.

# Tesla Price Cuts

Tesla has cut prices on all its electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The Model 3's entry price has been reduced by $1,000 to $41,990, while the Model Y has been cut by $2,000 to $49,990. Many analysts predicted that more Tesla price cuts were on the way to support demand, which could further cut into the company's prized margins.

# Google Stock

Google's stock jumped 3.8% on Thursday to 108.42 in above-normal volume, rallying past a cup-with-handle buy point of 106.69 according to MarketSmith analysis. Google's CEO announced that the company will soon add a chat AI to its search engine, following Microsoft's addition of ChatGPT to its Bing search engine and other products.

# Alibaba Stock

Alibaba's stock surged by 4.25% on Thursday to 102.74, breaking the downtrend of a cup-with-handle base and offering an early entry. The prior week saw a significant increase in BABA stock after Alibaba announced that it would split into six different units, each with their own CEOs and the option of filing for IPOs.

## Q&A

### Q: How will AI chatbots impact the job market in the future?
A: It's difficult to predict exactly how AI chatbots will impact the job market, but it's likely that they will automate some tasks currently done by humans, leading to job displacement in certain industries. At the same time, AI chatbots may create new job opportunities in fields such as data analysis and programming.

### Q: Will Tesla be able to maintain its high profit margins despite price cuts?
A: It's unclear whether Tesla will be able to maintain its high profit margins in the face of price cuts. While the price cuts may stimulate demand and lead to increased sales, they may also eat into the company's profits. Tesla will need to carefully balance pricing with production costs in order to maintain profitability.

### Q: How will the use of AI in search engines affect the way we access information?
A: The use of AI in search engines is likely to make it easier and faster to access relevant information. AI chatbots can understand natural language and provide more personalized search results, which could lead to a more efficient and effective search experience. However, there are also concerns about the potential for AI chatbots to create filter bubbles, where users only see information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.
