A Bloomberg survey of more than 5,000 Tesla Model 3 owners found many respondents had become disenchanted with the EV maker's owner Elon Musk in the four years since the outlet's last survey. Nevertheless, the owners were overall still very positive about the Model 3 and said they planned to stick with Tesla.

The Tesla Model 3 debuted in 2017 and quickly became the all-time best-selling electric vehicle worldwide. With its slick, grille-less design and spartan interior, the Model 3 redefined modern expectations for electric cars. It held 12 percent of the global EV market by itself in 2020.

However, reliability has been a topic of discussion among owners. While Honda and Toyota have a culture of reliability, the reliability of a car is impacted by how it is maintained and driven. Preemptive maintenance and care increase the life expectancy of a car, while extreme weather can affect the car's construction. Some Model 3 owners have reported common problems with door locks, and Consumer Reports had issues with the Model 3's braking distance, fit and finish, and body panel installation. In fact, Consumer Reports rated Tesla 30th out of 33 manufacturers for reliability. Despite these concerns, 87% of respondents in the Bloomberg survey said they were considering buying another Tesla for their next vehicle.

One significant aspect of the Model 3 is its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. While opinions on the FSD vary, there have been safety concerns raised. The Dawn Project claims that Tesla's FSD Beta software failed to detect a stationary, child-sized mannequin at an average speed of 25mph. The Dawn Project has launched an ad campaign urging the public to press Congress to ban Tesla's auto-driving technology, describing it as a lethal threat. Additionally, several investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are underway to examine the effectiveness of driver supervision and potential risks associated with Tesla's autopilot technology.

Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, has also made headlines with his social media presence. Musk has referred to Twitter as a war zone and has posted controversial tweets that resulted in fines and negative impacts on shareholders. His tweets have left many confused, but he remains a charismatic and influential figure in the industry.

Despite these challenges, Tesla remains at the forefront of the automotive industry. The Model 3 is the highest-rated car on the list of most satisfied car owners, with an average rating of 4.53 out of 5. Tesla holds the lead among automotive brands in terms of owner satisfaction, surpassing luxury rivals. Its drive quality has been praised by race car drivers, top auto journalists, and many others. The Model 3 excels in areas such as acceleration, fuel economy, and passenger and cargo space. With its lower base price compared to most vehicles on the list, the Model 3 offers the best value for the money.

In conclusion, the Tesla Model 3 has had its fair share of challenges and controversies but remains a highly regarded electric vehicle. It continues to dominate the market and satisfy its owners. With ongoing advancements in technology and a dedicated fanbase, Tesla's Model 3 is poised to shape the future of transportation.
