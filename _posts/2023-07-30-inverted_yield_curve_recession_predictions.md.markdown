Market veteran Ed Yardeni discusses the relationship between the inverted yield curve and recession predictions.

Yardeni explains that the yield curve has been inverted for more than a year, which has historically been an indicator of an impending recession. However, he notes that the yield curve is not a direct predictor of a recession but rather a signal of a process.

Despite the inverted yield curve, Yardeni points out that the US economy is currently showing signs of avoiding a recession. While there have been recessions in the housing and retailing sectors, Yardeni characterizes the current state of the US economy as a 'rolling recession,' where different sectors experience downturns at different times.

Looking at historical data, Yardeni reveals that the past eight recessions were preceded by yield curve inversions, indicating a correlation between the two. However, the occurrence of an inversion does not guarantee a recession.

Yardeni credits the Federal Reserve's quick response to the spring financial crisis for preventing a recession. Despite the banking crisis fading, the yield curve remains inverted, suggesting that bond traders expect the Fed to implement rate cuts as inflation slows.

While Yardeni acknowledges that there is still a possibility of a recession if the yield curve remains inverted and consumers deplete their savings, he also notes that the fed funds rate is expected to start falling in 2024.

Yardeni concludes on a positive note, stating that productivity growth can help keep inflation down and lead to a higher GDP growth rate.
