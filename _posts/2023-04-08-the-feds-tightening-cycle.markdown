## The Fed's Tightening Cycle

In the early 1980s, the United States experienced the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, with nearly 11 percent unemployment rate. The recession was triggered by tight monetary policy in an effort to fight mounting inflation. Paul Volcker was appointed chairman of the Fed in August 1979 in large part because of his anti-inflation views. Volcker shifted Fed policy to aggressively target the money supply rather than interest rates. His commitment to aggressively targeting price stability helped ensure that the double-digit inflation of the 1970s would not return.

## Markets Working with the Fed

Recently, the markets are suddenly working with the Fed rather than against it. The central bank officials have been repeating the same message that inflation is proving more stubborn than expected. Investors are betting that the Fed will cut rates not because the inflation monster is tamed, but in order to avoid breaking anything else.

## The Contradiction in the Markets

Investors think the Fed should fear bank failures enough to start cutting rates. On the other hand, they do not themselves fear the fallout of such a failure enough to reflect it in prices. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a mid-tier American lender that went bust on March 10th, sent shock waves through markets.

## The Fed's Job

The Fed's day-to-day activities include conducting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and providing payment services to maintain the stability of the financial system. During periods of acute financial strain, the Fed can provide emergency access to cash to financial markets and institutions through temporary open market operations and discount window lending. The severity of the financial crisis of 2007-2008 prompted the Fed to implement temporary emergency lending programs to provide funding to nonbank financial institutions and stabilize the financial system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Fed must get approval from the Treasury Department before exercising its extraordinary lending authority, and it cannot create programs designed to support individual entities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed announced nine special lending programs within the span of 24 days, using its Section 13(3) emergency lending powers to stabilize financial conditions in the midst of the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic.

# GPT asks and answers

## Q&A:

### Q: How will the potential failure of banks impact the stability of the financial system in the future?
A: The Fed's role in providing emergency access to cash to financial markets and institutions through temporary open market operations and discount window lending is crucial in times of financial strain. However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Fed must get approval from the Treasury Department before exercising its extraordinary lending authority, and it cannot create programs designed to support individual entities. This means that the impact of potential bank failures on the stability of the financial system may depend on whether or not the Treasury Department approves the Fed's actions.

### Q: How are markets currently working with the Fed?
A: Recently, the markets are suddenly working with the Fed rather than against it. This could mean that investors have faith in the Fed's ability to maintain the stability of the financial system, or it could indicate that investors are betting that the Fed will cut rates to avoid breaking anything else. The contradiction in the markets is that investors do not themselves fear the fallout of bank failures enough to reflect it in prices, yet they think the Fed should fear bank failures enough to start cutting rates.

### Q: How will the potential failure of nonbank financial institutions impact the financial system in the future?
A: The severity of the financial crisis of 2007-2008 prompted the Fed to implement temporary emergency lending programs to provide funding to nonbank financial institutions and stabilize the financial system. However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Fed must get approval from the Treasury Department before exercising its extraordinary lending authority, and it cannot create programs designed to support individual entities. This means that the impact of potential nonbank financial institution failures on the stability of the financial system may depend on whether or not the Treasury Department approves the Fed's actions. Additionally, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a mid-tier American lender, sent shock waves through markets, indicating that the failure of nonbank financial institutions could have a significant impact on the financial system.
