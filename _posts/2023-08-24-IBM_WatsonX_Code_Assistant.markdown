IBM has announced the launch of the WatsonX Code Assistant, an AI-powered tool designed to modernize legacy COBOL code running on its Z mainframe systems. The tool aims to assist human developers in analyzing, refactoring, and testing the new code, ultimately helping organizations decouple individual services from monolithic COBOL apps.

COBOL is a widely used programming language for mainframe applications, but updating and extending legacy COBOL codebases can be costly. With the WatsonX Code Assistant, IBM aims to make the process more efficient and cost-effective.

The code assistant follows a three-step approach: Refactor, Transform, and Validate. AI assistance plays a crucial role in moving COBOL forward while keeping it functional. The tool generates Java code that is interoperable with COBOL and certain mainframe functions.

One of the main advantages of modernizing COBOL code to Java is optimization. Java programs can run on the IBM zIIP specialty processor, reducing MLC costs. Additionally, Java is portable across multiple hardware platforms, making it easier to find programmers with Java skills than COBOL skills.

IBM's WatsonX Code Assistant for Z is expected to be available globally as a service in the fourth quarter of 2023. The tool uses the IBM WatsonX.ai foundation model, which was trained on 115 code languages and 1.5 trillion tokens of data. It integrates with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to provide feedback and tips during code refactoring.

By automating the conversion of COBOL to Java, the WatsonX Code Assistant reduces the time, effort, and human error involved. It ensures that the COBOL code and the Java translation are semantically equivalent and have the same result.

IBM's announcement of the WatsonX Code Assistant for Z highlights the company's commitment to modernizing legacy systems and leveraging AI in the process. The tool is part of IBM's larger AI ecosystem, which includes WatsonX.ai, WatsonX.data, and WatsonX.governance.

With the WatsonX Code Assistant, IBM is paving the way for organizations to update their mainframe applications, bringing substantial benefits in terms of optimization, cost reduction, and ongoing support. The tool's generative AI capabilities make it faster and more efficient in translating COBOL code to Java, ultimately enabling organizations to make the most of their existing mainframe assets.

In conclusion, IBM's WatsonX Code Assistant is a groundbreaking solution for modernizing legacy COBOL code and transitioning it to Java. By incorporating AI into the process, IBM aims to streamline the code conversion process, making it easier and more cost-effective for organizations to update their mainframe systems.


# ChatGPT AI Asks and Answers
## How will the WatsonX Code Assistant impact the cost and efficiency of updating and extending legacy COBOL codebases?
The WatsonX Code Assistant will significantly impact the cost and efficiency of updating and extending legacy COBOL codebases. Traditionally, updating and extending COBOL codebases has been a manual and time-consuming process, requiring developers to have a deep understanding of the legacy codebase. This often leads to high costs and potential errors. However, with the WatsonX Code Assistant, the process becomes more automated and efficient. The AI-powered tool can analyze the existing COBOL codebase, identify areas that need to be updated or extended, and generate Java code that is interoperable with COBOL. This not only reduces the time and effort involved in the update process but also minimizes the risk of human error. As a result, organizations can save costs associated with manual code updates and achieve faster time-to-market for new features and functionalities.

## What are the advantages of modernizing COBOL code to Java using the WatsonX Code Assistant?
Modernizing COBOL code to Java using the WatsonX Code Assistant offers several advantages. First, it enables organizations to take advantage of Java's optimization capabilities. Java programs can run on the IBM zIIP specialty processor, which helps reduce MLC costs, a significant expense for organizations running COBOL applications on mainframe systems. By translating COBOL code to Java, organizations can leverage Java's optimized execution environment, resulting in improved performance and cost savings. Another advantage is the availability of a larger pool of Java programmers compared to COBOL programmers. Finding skilled COBOL developers can be challenging, but Java is a widely used programming language, and there is a larger talent pool available. This makes it easier for organizations to find skilled programmers to maintain and enhance their modernized Java codebase. Additionally, modernizing COBOL to Java allows organizations to leverage Java's cross-platform portability. Java programs can run on multiple hardware platforms, providing flexibility and reducing dependence on specific mainframe systems.

## How does the WatsonX Code Assistant ensure that the COBOL code and the Java translation are semantically equivalent?
The WatsonX Code Assistant ensures that the COBOL code and the Java translation are semantically equivalent through advanced AI techniques and rigorous testing. The tool follows a multi-step approach that includes analyzing, refactoring, and testing the new code. During the refactoring process, the AI-powered tool identifies and transforms the COBOL code into Java code while preserving the functionality and semantics of the original code. The AI model behind the WatsonX Code Assistant has been trained on a vast amount of code languages and data, allowing it to understand the nuances and intricacies of both COBOL and Java. The generated Java code is then thoroughly validated to ensure that it produces the same results as the original COBOL code. This validation process involves extensive testing and comparison of the output produced by both the COBOL code and the translated Java code. By employing rigorous testing and leveraging AI capabilities, the WatsonX Code Assistant guarantees that the transition from COBOL to Java is seamless and that the resulting code is functionally equivalent to the original COBOL implementation.
