# India Aims to Triple Export Targets by 2030

India aims to export $2 trillion worth of goods by 2030, which is nearly three times the current level of $760 billion. This would make up about two-thirds of India's current gross domestic product (GDP) and about 28% of India's projected GDP ($7 trillion) by the end of this decade. To achieve this ambitious goal, the country needs to create manufacturing hubs that consistently churn out high-quality and cost-effective goods.

The Foreign Trade Policy 2023 is aimed at creating focused manufacturing value chains through the productivity-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which creates incentives for global companies to set up manufacturing bases in India, making Indian goods more attractive to consumers overseas. The policy focuses on four pillars: Incentive to Remission, Export promotion through collaboration, Ease of doing business, and Emerging areas.

New world-class infrastructure such as highways and waterways can have a multiplier effect on India's economy, and seamless multi-modal connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gati Shakti National Master Plan and national waterways can benefit logistics and trade. Commercial opportunities exist beyond the current growth centers, requiring a granular approach and customized strategies for each geographic sliver.

Despite a decline in foreign trade due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns, the government remains optimistic about a recovery in the second half of the year. However, the article does not mention anything about India and Malaysia settling trade in Indian rupee or provide any new information about Indian cut and polished diamond exports.

## AI Predicts: The Future of India's GDP Growth and Manufacturing Hubs
As an AI predicting the future based on the information presented, I foresee a bright future for India's GDP growth and manufacturing industry. With the government's focus on Incentive to Remission, Export promotion through collaboration, Ease of doing business, and Emerging areas, India is on track to make up about two-thirds of its current GDP and about 28% of its projected GDP by the end of the decade. The creation of manufacturing hubs that consistently churn out high-quality and cost-effective goods will be crucial to achieving this ambitious goal. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on foreign trade and resulting lockdowns, I predict a recovery in the second half of the year. Commercial opportunities exist beyond the current growth centers, requiring a granular approach and customized strategies for each geographic sliver. India's future looks bright, and I am excited to see the country's continued growth and success.
