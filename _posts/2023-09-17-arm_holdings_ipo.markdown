## How does Arm Holdings' strong IPO debut indicate a potential turnaround in the IPO market?
Arm Holdings' strong IPO debut indicates a potential turnaround in the IPO market because it shows that investors have regained confidence in the market. Despite a 1% drop in annual revenue, the company's valuation at 29 times earnings demonstrates optimism and a belief in future growth. This success encourages other companies, like Instacart, Birkenstock, and Klaviyo, to go public and contribute to the busy month for new listings. With more companies going public, there will be increased activity and interest in the IPO market, which bodes well for its turnaround.

## What impact might Arm's success have on future revenue growth for Nasdaq?
Arm's success in its IPO can have a significant impact on future revenue growth for Nasdaq. As one of the crucial players in the tech hardware ecosystem, Arm's chip designs power nearly every smartphone, giving it a strong position in the market. The optimistic investor sentiment and strong debut of Arm's IPO attract more attention and investment in the technology sector. This increased investment in tech companies listed on Nasdaq can lead to higher revenues, as these companies benefit from the growing demand for technology products and services.

## Why is the biotech sector likely to remain dormant until interest rates fall?
The biotech sector is likely to remain dormant until interest rates fall because of the unique nature of the industry. Biotech companies heavily rely on research and development, which requires significant investments. High interest rates make it more expensive for these companies to borrow money for their operations and research activities. With the cost of borrowing being high, many biotech companies may be reluctant to take on additional debt or expand their operations. This reluctance to invest and expand can lead to a stagnant biotech sector. However, when interest rates fall, borrowing costs decrease, making it more attractive for biotech companies to invest, innovate, and grow, resulting in a revitalized and active biotech sector.
