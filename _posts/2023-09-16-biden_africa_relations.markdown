## How does the Biden administration plan to counter China's growing influence in Africa?
The Biden administration plans to counter China's growing influence in Africa by strategically investing in African countries and institutions. They aim to deepen economic ties with Africa and make up lost ground in the geopolitical competition with China. Through initiatives like lending up to $21 billion through the International Monetary Fund, signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, and making regional compacts and investments through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. seeks to strengthen African economies and promote sustainable development. Additionally, the Biden administration is actively engaged in promoting democratic governance and enhancing security cooperation in Africa through initiatives like the African Democratic and Political Transitions and the 21st Century Partnership for African Security. By countering China's influence and fostering economic growth, the Biden administration aims to ensure that African countries have sustainable and equitable partnerships that serve their long-term interests.

## What are some of the initiatives and investments that the Biden administration is making in Africa?
The Biden administration is making several initiatives and investments in Africa to strengthen economic relations and promote sustainable development on the continent. They have pledged to invest over $50 billion in the next three years to support African institutions and citizens. Some of the specific initiatives include lending up to $21 billion through the International Monetary Fund for African countries, signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, and making regional compacts and investments through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation is also investing in key sectors such as food security, renewable energy, and health projects in Africa. The Initiative on Digital Transformation aims to expand digital access and literacy across the continent, further boosting economic growth and development. Additionally, the Biden administration is investing in the health workforce in the Africa region and strengthening global health security programs. They are also planning to accelerate regional manufacturing of vaccines, tests, and therapeutics, and establish a strategic partnership for resilient food systems and emergency food security assistance. Furthermore, the U.S. has launched the African Democratic and Political Transitions initiative and the 21st Century Partnership for African Security to promote democratic governance and enhance security cooperation in Africa. These initiatives and investments demonstrate the Biden administration's commitment to deepening U.S.-Africa economic ties and supporting the sustainable development of the continent.

## What are the goals of the U.S.-Nigeria relationship and how is Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo involved?
The U.S.-Nigeria relationship has several goals, and Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo is actively involved in strengthening this relationship. One of the goals is to deepen economic ties and promote trade and investment between the two countries. Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, and enhancing economic cooperation with Nigeria is a priority for the Biden administration. Wally Adeyemo, who was born in Nigeria and emigrated to the United States, serves as a unique emissary to strengthen the U.S.-Nigeria relationship. He has been actively engaged in participating in roundtable discussions and highlighting the economic and cultural ties between the two countries. Another goal of the U.S.-Nigeria relationship is to collaborate on issues of mutual interest such as security and counterterrorism. Nigeria is a key player in the fight against terrorism in West Africa, and the United States seeks to enhance security cooperation with Nigeria to address regional security challenges. Additionally, the U.S. aims to support Nigeria's efforts in democratic governance, promoting human rights, and fostering sustainable development. Overall, the U.S.-Nigeria relationship with the involvement of Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo aims to strengthen economic cooperation, enhance security cooperation, and promote shared values and interests between the United States and Nigeria.
