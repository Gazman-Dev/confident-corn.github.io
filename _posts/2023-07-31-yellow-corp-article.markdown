Yellow Corp., a trucking company that has been in operation for 99 years, has recently halted its operations and will be laying off all 30,000 of its workers. The company has been engaged in a battle with the Teamsters union over pension and health insurance plans. Although the union canceled a threatened strike and granted the company an extra month to make the required payments, a new contract agreement could not be reached. As a result, the company has filed for bankruptcy.

The closure of Yellow will cause higher rates for shippers who depend on LTL carriers. Yellow was known as one of the Big Three of the trucking industry.

Yellow Corp. is reportedly preparing for bankruptcy, as it has accumulated significant debts over time. The company has a $700 million pandemic-era loan from the government, but it owes over $700 million to the Treasury department. A Congressional probe concluded that Yellow's financial position exposes taxpayers to significant risk. Yellow's stock has also lost 82% of its value.

In addition to its financial troubles, Yellow Corp. has been involved in legal disputes. The company settled a dispute over charges of defrauding the government by overbilling on shipments. Yellow Corp. also settled with the Department of Defense regarding allegations of overcharging the U.S. government. The company agreed to pay nearly $7 million to resolve civil litigation.

Yellow Corp.'s financial troubles have had a direct impact on its employees. The company has laid off an unknown number of employees and is at risk of liquidation. Driver's pensions are also at risk, as Yellow withheld $50 million in pension and healthcare payments. The Central States Pension Fund has announced that Yellow Corp. will be booted out of the fund on July 23.

Yellow Corp.'s terminal reduction plan is another strategy it is employing to mitigate its financial troubles. The company expects to reduce the number of terminals in its network from 316 to 300 by year-end. The restructuring plan, called 'One Yellow,' aims to bring all LTL carriers and logistics company onto the same tech platform.

In the first quarter of 2023, Yellow Corp. reported its best first quarter in six years, with an improved operating ratio. However, the company still made a loss of $54.6 million. Yellow Corp. expects the restructuring plan to result in cost savings and improved performance.

Despite ongoing negotiations with the Teamsters, Yellow Corp. was unable to reach an agreement on a new contract. The union threatened to strike, but eventually canceled the strike and granted the company an extra month to make the required payments. However, a new contract agreement could not be reached, leading to Yellow Corp.'s decision to file for bankruptcy.

If Yellow Corp. files for bankruptcy, prices will go up and customers may divert shipments to other carriers. The closure of Yellow Corp. marks the end of a business that was deemed critical to the nation's supply chains.

In conclusion, Yellow Corp.'s decision to halt operations and lay off all 30,000 workers has sent shockwaves through the trucking industry. The company's financial troubles, legal disputes, and inability to reach a new contract agreement with the Teamsters union have all contributed to its decision to file for bankruptcy. The closure of Yellow Corp. will have significant implications for the industry and its employees, as well as for shippers who rely on LTL carriers. The story of Yellow Corp.'s downfall serves as a warning of the challenges and risks faced by companies in the ever-changing business landscape.
