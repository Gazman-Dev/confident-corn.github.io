OrderedDict([('title', "Trump's Former Cabinet Members and the 2024 Presidential Race"), ('content', "Less than 10% of Trump's former cabinet members publicly endorse his 2024 re-election campaign. Some are actively working against him, while others have spoken out against his run.\n\nOnly four of Trump's former cabinet members openly endorsed his re-election run. Several former cabinet members declined to comment or didn't respond to inquiries. Some former cabinet members are actively working to prevent Trump's nomination. Former cabinet members, such as Bill Barr and Mick Mulvaney, have spoken out against Trump's run for re-election. Trump has a history of firing members of his administration who he believes are not loyal to him.\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman resigned from her position as Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison. She was one of Trump's most high-profile African-American supporters and a former contestant on 'The Apprentice'. Her role began to feel ill-defined under chief of staff John Kelly, and she resigned to pursue other opportunities.\n\nIn addition, former Vice President Mike Pence has formally announced his campaign for the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential race. Pence joins a crowded and still growing field of Republican candidates, led by Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Pence's campaign filed a declaration of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission and is expected to launch his campaign in Iowa. Pence, a staunch social conservative and evangelical Christian, has increasingly distanced himself from Trump after rejecting his demands to overturn the 2020 election. Pence is framing himself as a traditional Republican concerned with fiscal responsibility and family values, capable of delivering Trump's economic policies without the drama.\n\nThe Republican field seeking to deny former President Donald Trump his party's nomination in 2024 has grown, with Senate Republicans endorsing candidates other than Trump. Senate Minority Whip John Thune appeared alongside Senator Tim Scott at a campaign launch, endorsing someone other than Trump. Senator Bill Cassidy, who has not yet endorsed for 2024, discussed Trump's general election prospects and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' argument.\n\nThe 2024 presidential race is shaping up to be highly competitive, with Trump facing challenges from his own former cabinet members, as well as other Republican candidates. The lack of support from his former cabinet members is a significant blow to Trump's re-election campaign, as it reflects a lack of confidence and loyalty from those who worked closely with him. Additionally, the entrance of Mike Pence into the race adds another layer of competition, as Pence seeks to differentiate himself as a traditional Republican with a focus on conservative values and economic policies.\n\nOverall, the 2024 presidential race promises to be a long and exciting journey, with multiple candidates vying for the Republican nomination and attempting to unseat former President Donald Trump.")])
