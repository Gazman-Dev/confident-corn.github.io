## How will the wildfires in Maui impact the future of the hotel industry and the workers?
The wildfires in Maui will have a significant impact on the future of the hotel industry and the workers. Many hotels and resorts in Maui have been destroyed or damaged by the fires, resulting in a loss of accommodation options for tourists. This will have a negative effect on the tourism industry, as visitors may choose to cancel or postpone their trips to Maui. The workers in the hotel industry will also be greatly affected, as many may lose their jobs due to the destruction of hotels and a decrease in tourists. This will lead to financial hardship for the workers and their families, and they will need support and assistance in finding new employment opportunities.

## What role does the Biden-Harris Administration play in the recovery efforts in Maui?
The Biden-Harris Administration plays a crucial role in the recovery efforts in Maui. They have mobilized a whole-of-government response effort to support rescue and recovery in Maui, Hawaii. Federal departments and agencies such as DHS, FEMA, the Coast Guard, DOD, HHS, the U.S. Forest Service, and the SBA are involved in assessing the needs of the affected communities and providing necessary resources. President Biden has signed a Major Disaster Declaration for Hawaii, offering additional assistance. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell, and SBA Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman have visited Maui to survey the damage and show support for impacted communities. Federal personnel are deployed to assist residents, and various federal agencies are providing aid in search and rescue operations, fire suppression efforts, shelter supplies, financial assistance, and more. The Biden-Harris Administration's involvement demonstrates their commitment to helping the people of Maui recover and rebuild after this devastating wildfire.

## What long-term measures can be taken to prevent and mitigate the impact of future wildfires in Hawaii?
To prevent and mitigate the impact of future wildfires in Hawaii, several long-term measures can be taken. Firstly, there needs to be a focus on forest management and fire prevention. This includes proper thinning of trees and vegetation, creating firebreaks, and implementing controlled burns to reduce fuel loads. Additionally, the state should invest in early warning systems and improved communication infrastructure to ensure timely evacuation orders and alert residents about potential fire threats. Education and awareness campaigns should be conducted to educate residents and visitors about fire safety practices and the importance of preventing wildfires. Enhancing firefighting capabilities by providing adequate resources, training, and equipment to fire departments is essential. Furthermore, incorporating climate change considerations into land-use planning and development regulations can help prevent the spread of wildfires in vulnerable areas. Finally, promoting sustainable and resilient building practices can minimize the destruction caused by wildfires and protect both human and animal habitats. These long-term measures require collaboration between government agencies, community organizations, and the public to effectively address the wildfire risks in Hawaii and ensure the safety of its residents and environment.
