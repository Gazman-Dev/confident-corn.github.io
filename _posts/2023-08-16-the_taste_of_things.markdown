The French drama 'The Pot-au-Feu' has been renamed 'The Taste of Things' and is being considered for awards. It stars Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magime and follows the story of a renowned chef and his romance with his personal cook and lover. The film has received critical acclaim and won the best director prize at its premiere.

The screenplay is based on Marcel Rouffe's novel 'The Passionate Epicure', and the director, Trần Anh Hùng, aimed to make a film that stood out from the rest. Variety film critic Guy Lodge praised the film for its beauty, indulgence, and human care.

The movie was acquired by IFC Films and Sapan Studio, which is run by former AMC Networks CEO Josh Sapan. It has a solid chance to break out in other categories, like acting, screenplay, and cinematography.

Isabelle Huppert's new film, 'Elle', is also making waves in the industry. The actress has delivered a memorable performance, and Dan Callahan has taken a look back at her most memorable roles.

Trần Anh Hùng's 'The Taste of Things' is set in late-19th century France and is loosely based on Marcel Rouffe's novel 'The Passionate Epicure'. It depicts scenes from the life of the fictional bon vivant Dodin Bouffant, played by the excellent Benoît Magimel. Bouffant lives with his personal cook/lover Eugénie, portrayed by Juliette Binoche, and organizes weekend feasts for his salivating circle of friends. The film beautifully handles cookery as both poetry and performance art.

The Pot Au Feu succeeds as a celebration of the senses, with an insistent parallel between individual and national consciousness. The lack of a rhetorical kicker adds to the power of the parallel. The struggle to keep and curate memories is a central theme of the film.

The producer of 'The Taste of Things', Olivier Delbosc, is an industry veteran who has marked his 100th feature film production this year. He launched Curiosa Films in 2015 and has collaborated with renowned directors such as François Ozon, Gaspar Noé, Claire Denis, and Xavier Giannoli. Delbosc is also working on high-end TV series Tikkoun, along with Laetitia Colombani and Xavier Giannoli.

With its captivating story, stunning performances, and exploration of culinary art, 'The Taste of Things' is a must-watch film that showcases the talent and creativity of the French film industry.
