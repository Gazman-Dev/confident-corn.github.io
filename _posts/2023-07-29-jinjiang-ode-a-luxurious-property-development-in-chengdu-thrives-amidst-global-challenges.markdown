Title: Jinjiang Ode: A Luxurious Property Development in Chengdu Thrives Amidst Global Challenges

Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in China, has become a hotbed for young Chinese individuals seeking a leisurely lifestyle and tongue-numbing local cuisine. The prestigious Jinjiang Ode property development in central Chengdu has captured the attention of wealthy buyers, who are drawn to its exclusivity and luxury. With its four-meter-high palatial gates, potential buyers must make appointments to enter, adding to the allure of this opulent development.

Despite the global economic challenges, Chengdu's property market has shown remarkable resilience. The city's hospitality industry has played a significant role in its economic growth, contributing 65.7% to the city's GDP in 2020. As the pandemic is gradually controlled and the economy recovers, Chengdu's hotels have reached performance levels comparable to 2019, leading the hotel performance recovery in China.

The property market in Chengdu has also demonstrated its strength, with new home sales between April and June 2021 being nearly a third higher than the same period in 2019. Furthermore, home prices in Chengdu have risen by 8% in May compared to the previous year, the highest increase among large cities in China. These positive trends highlight the city's resilience and attractiveness in the property market.

Chengdu has been proactive in implementing measures and policies to promote electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable infrastructure, in line with global trends. The city has introduced fiscal incentives to encourage the adoption of EVs and support the growth of EV manufacturing and battery industries. Efforts have also been made to develop EV charging infrastructure, enhancing the value and convenience of EVs. These initiatives showcase Chengdu's commitment to environmental sustainability and reducing carbon emissions.

To address the crisis of confidence in the real estate sector, the Chinese government has planned to launch a real estate fund worth up to 300 billion yuan ($44.5 billion), providing financial support to developers. Additionally, 1 trillion yuan ($148.2 billion) in loans will be issued for stalled developments, stimulating the real estate sector and restoring confidence in the market.

Chengdu's success in the property market can be attributed to high demand, attractive incentives, and limited supply. The city's increase in new home sales and rising prices demonstrate the strong demand for housing, particularly among younger Chinese individuals. Chengdu's implementation of high-level purchase controls, exclusively allowing residents with local hukou to buy homes, has created a sense of exclusivity and further increased demand. The city's housing subsidies and cash rewards have also attracted educated workers, stimulating economic growth.

With a population growth of over 7 million from 2011 to 2021, Chengdu's housing demand continues to rise, contributing to its success in the property market. Looking ahead, the city shows promising growth potential and fiscal stability. Hangzhou, Changsha, and coastal cities like Qingdao are also expected to experience positive economic growth and attract population inflows.

In conclusion, Chengdu's property market has defied global challenges and emerged as a thriving hub of luxury and exclusivity. Its attractive incentives, high demand for housing, and strong economic growth position it for continued success. By promoting sustainability, addressing the crisis of confidence, and leveraging its unique strengths, Chengdu can continue to flourish in the property market and contribute to China's overall economic growth.
