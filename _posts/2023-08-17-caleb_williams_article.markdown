## How has the rise of name, image, and likeness endorsements affected college football?
The rise of name, image, and likeness endorsements has had a significant impact on college football. It has allowed players to profit from their fame and has created new opportunities for them to generate income. With NIL endorsements, players can now sign endorsement deals, sponsor products, and participate in advertising campaigns. This has not only given them the ability to make money while still in college but has also raised their profile and visibility. It has created a more competitive environment, as players now have an added incentive to perform well on the field to attract sponsors and fans. Additionally, it has changed the recruiting landscape, as schools can now use NIL endorsements as a selling point to attract top talent. This shift has also sparked debates and discussions about fair compensation in college sports and has forced institutions and governing bodies to adapt to this new era.

## What are the potential long-lasting effects of USC and UCLA leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten?
The potential long-lasting effects of USC and UCLA leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten are significant. This move will undoubtedly reshape the landscape of college football, affecting conference dynamics, rivalries, and revenue distribution. It will impact not only the Pac-12 and the Big Ten but also other conferences and schools that may need to realign to maintain competitive balance. The departure of USC and UCLA, two prominent and historically successful programs, will weaken the Pac-12 and potentially strengthen the Big Ten. This could lead to a power shift in college football, with the Big Ten solidifying its status as one of the premier conferences. It may also impact television contracts and media coverage, as the presence of USC and UCLA in the Big Ten could attract more viewership and media attention. Additionally, the move could have financial implications, as conference revenue-sharing models may need to be adjusted. Overall, USC and UCLA leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten will have far-reaching effects that will shape the future of college football.
