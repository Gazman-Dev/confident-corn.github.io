## What are the potential alternatives to Kylian Mbappé for Real Madrid?
In addition to Kylian Mbappé, Real Madrid has identified Erling Haaland and Julián Álvarez as potential alternatives. Haaland, the Borussia Dortmund striker, has been impressive and is attracting interest from top clubs across Europe. Álvarez, who currently plays for Manchester City, is considering leaving the club due to a lack of game time. Madrid sees both players as valuable additions to their attacking lineup and is exploring the possibility of signing them in case they are unable to secure Mbappé's services.

## How has the transfer ban in 2016 and 2017 affected Real Madrid's transfer activity?
The transfer ban that Real Madrid faced in 2016 and 2017 had a significant impact on their transfer activity. During these periods, the club was unable to make signings, which limited their ability to strengthen the squad. This forced Madrid to rely on existing players and make the most out of the talent they already had. While the ban posed challenges, it also provided opportunities for young players to step up and prove their worth. Overall, the transfer ban forced Real Madrid to be more resourceful and strategic in their approach to player recruitment.

## What is the Expected Transfer Value (xTV) model and how can it benefit clubs and agents in player transfers?
The Expected Transfer Value (xTV) model is an AI-powered technology that offers an accurate estimation of transfer fees for players. It takes into account various factors such as player performance, age, contract duration, and market trends to provide an objective valuation. The xTV model benefits clubs and agents in player transfers by providing them with a reliable and informed assessment of a player's market value. This helps clubs make more informed decisions when it comes to buying or selling players, ensuring that they get a fair deal. For agents, the xTV model can help them negotiate contracts and transfer fees more effectively, maximizing the financial outcome for their clients. Overall, the xTV model brings transparency and efficiency to player transfers, benefiting all parties involved.
