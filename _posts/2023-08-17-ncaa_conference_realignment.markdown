## How will the grant of rights agreement impact the future of conference realignment?
The grant of rights agreement will have a significant impact on the future of conference realignment. Since the agreement transfers media rights to the conference, it prevents schools from leaving the conference and joining another. This restricts the movement of teams and limits the options for conferences looking to expand. Without the ability to add schools from conferences with grant of rights agreements, conferences like the Big Ten and SEC will have to explore other options for expansion, potentially leading to unconventional realignment strategies.

## What are the potential consequences of schools leaving conferences due to revenue distribution changes?
The potential consequences of schools leaving conferences due to revenue distribution changes are far-reaching. One consequence is the disruption of established rivalries and traditions. Schools that have a long history of competing against each other may be forced to separate if one school decides to leave for financial reasons. This can result in a loss of fan support and a decrease in overall interest in college athletics. Additionally, the departure of a school can have negative financial implications for the remaining schools in the conference. The revenue distribution model may need to be adjusted, leading to possible financial challenges for the remaining schools. This can also impact the level of competition within the conference, as the departure of a strong team can weaken the overall competitiveness of the conference.

## How might the expansion plans of the Big Ten and SEC affect the overall landscape of college athletics?
The expansion plans of the Big Ten and SEC have the potential to reshape the overall landscape of college athletics. By adding popular teams from other conferences, these two conferences aim to strengthen their position and increase their influence. This could lead to further consolidation of power among a few dominant conferences. As a result, smaller conferences may struggle to compete and may need to reconsider their strategies and goals. Additionally, the expansion plans could impact the geographical distribution of teams across conferences. The addition of schools from different regions may lead to increased travel distances and logistical challenges for athletes and fans. Overall, the expansion plans of the Big Ten and SEC will likely have ripple effects throughout the entire college athletics ecosystem.

        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>The NCAA conference realignment is a hot topic, with the Big Ten and SEC at the forefront of discussions. Both conferences have made it clear that they do not have much desire to add schools like Clemson and Florida State from the ACC, citing various reasons.</p>
<p>One factor contributing to the reluctance of the Big Ten and SEC to consider adding ACC schools is the ACC's grant of rights agreement. This agreement seems to prevent such movements and has a significant impact on realignment possibilities. The ACC's grant of rights lasts until June 30, 2036, and effectively transfers media rights to the conference. This makes challenging the agreement risky and expensive, as demonstrated by recent analyses.</p>
<p>The Big Ten and SEC, on the other hand, have ambitious expansion plans. They aim to have a total of 34 teams by the 2024 season, including popular teams from the NCAA. Recent realignment movements have already seen schools like Washington, Oregon, UCLA, and USC join the Big Ten, reshaping the college sports landscape. As a result, the Pac-12 now only has four teams left, and the Mountain West and the AAC are competing to add the remaining Pac-12 teams.</p>
<p>Stanford and Cal, two prestigious institutions, were under consideration to join the ACC. However, they fell one vote short of approval, leaving their fate uncertain. The ACC's potential expansion options include exploring California and Stanford, despite their unknown financial value. There is speculation that these schools would be a better fit for the AAC or even other conferences.</p>
<p>Media rights deals and revenue sharing have become significant concerns due to the shifting landscape in college sports. The changing dynamics have raised questions about the future of college athletics and the sustainability of revenue distribution. Florida State, in particular, has expressed the possibility of leaving the ACC due to revenue distribution changes, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing conference realignment discussions.</p>
<p>Amidst the uncertainty and speculations, one thing is clear - the concerns over media rights deals and revenue sharing are expected to decrease movement across conferences. The value of media rights money is being debated against other sources of revenue, with the belief that joining a stronger conference does not necessarily make a team more competitive.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the NCAA conference realignment is an intriguing battle for supremacy that is reshaping the landscape of college sports. With the Big Ten and SEC expanding their reach, the ACC navigating through grant of rights agreements, and the Pac-12 facing the risk of losing more teams, the future of college athletics hangs in the balance. As negotiations, debates, and speculations continue, only time will tell how the conference realignment saga will unfold.</p>
