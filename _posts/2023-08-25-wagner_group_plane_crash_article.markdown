In a shocking turn of events, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, and Dmitri Utkin were listed as passengers on a plane that crashed near Moscow. This incident comes shortly after Prigozhin led a rebellion against Russia's military leadership, causing a significant rupture in the relationship between the two parties.

According to Russian aviation authorities, Prigozhin's name appeared on the passenger manifest of the ill-fated plane. Several Russian news outlets reported on this tragic event, but the uncertainty surrounding Prigozhin's fate remains, with a Telegram account associated with the Wagner group stating that his status is still unknown.

The presence of Dmitri Utkin, Wagner's most prominent commander, on the same flight raises further questions about the circumstances of the crash. Utkin, often described as the co-founder of the mercenary group, had an obsessive fascination with the history of the Third Reich, which apparently served as the inspiration for the group's name. Utkin's role within the Wagner group has been a subject of debate, with some speculating that he was merely a frontman for someone else.

Prigozhin's rebellion against Russia's military leadership in June created waves within the country. Despite his actions, he continued to move freely, even meeting with President Vladimir Putin on June 29. However, his falling out with the Russian government became apparent after years of supporting Putin, as he began openly criticizing it.

In a series of events from the Extra JSON sources, Prigozhin's rebellion took a more intense turn. He accused Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu of ordering an attack on Wagner forces, which prompted the Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) to call on Wagner fighters not to follow Prigozhin's orders and assist in his arrest. Prigozhin denied that the rebellion was a military coup and instead referred to it as a 'march for justice.'

These bold accusations made by Prigozhin have sparked concerns both domestically and internationally. The White House National Security Council is closely monitoring the situation and consulting with allies and partners. General Sergey Surovikin, a key figure in Russia's military, urged Wagner fighters to abandon the rebellion and return to loyalty.

Prigozhin's criticism of the military leadership and the Russian government is a criminal offense in the country. Despite this, some experts speculate that Prigozhin may be speaking with the tacit approval of the Kremlin. His remarks, which imply that Putin is weak and easily manipulated, have raised eyebrows and put the spotlight on the relationship between the president and wealthy businessmen.

In addition to his accusations against Shoigu, Prigozhin has also criticized the Russian defense ministry's portrayal of the ongoing counteroffensive in southern Ukraine. He claims that Russia's army is actually retreating in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and accuses the defense ministry of deceiving the president with false reports.

The context provided by the Extra JSON sources sheds light on the Wagner group's activities beyond the current rebellion. The group has gained influence as one of Russia's most prominent foreign policy tools, involved in conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. It has expanded its footprint in Africa, offering military support and security services in exchange for resource concessions and diplomatic support.

However, the recent plane crash and the presumed death of Prigozhin and Utkin raise questions about the future of the Wagner group. Prigozhin's charisma, economic powers, and political connections have been instrumental in the group's operations. Without him, the group's direction and influence may face uncertainty.

The story of the Wagner group and its leaders is a tale of rebellion and power. It highlights the complexities of Russia's military dynamics and the influence of private mercenary groups in shaping foreign policy. The repercussions of these events are sure to reverberate both domestically and internationally, as the world watches how the Russian government handles this situation.

## How will the presumed death of Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitri Utkin affect the future of the Wagner group?
The presumed death of Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitri Utkin will have significant implications for the future of the Wagner group. Prigozhin, as the founder and charismatic leader of the group, played a crucial role in its operations, including forging political connections and securing economic resources. His absence will leave a void in the group's leadership, potentially leading to power struggles and internal conflicts within the organization. Moreover, Prigozhin's network and influence were essential in expanding the Wagner group's activities beyond Russia, particularly in Africa. Without his leadership and connections, the group may struggle to maintain its current level of influence and may face challenges in securing future contracts and resources.

## What are the potential repercussions of Prigozhin's rebellion and criticism of Russia's military leadership?
Prigozhin's rebellion and criticism of Russia's military leadership carry significant potential repercussions. Firstly, it exposes internal divisions and conflicts within the Russian military establishment. Prigozhin's allegations of Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu ordering an attack on Wagner forces highlight a rift between different factions within the military and raise questions about the overall command and control structure. This can lead to distrust, low morale, and compromised effectiveness within the Russian military. Secondly, Prigozhin's rebellion challenges the authority of the Russian government and its ability to maintain discipline and loyalty among its military personnel. A public display of dissent and rebellion undermines the government's image of strength and control, potentially encouraging further acts of defiance. Lastly, the international community will closely observe the Russian government's response to Prigozhin's rebellion. If the government tries to suppress the uprising with force, it could lead to further criticism and condemnation from the international community, potentially damaging Russia's reputation on the global stage.

## How might the relationship between President Putin and wealthy businessmen be impacted by Prigozhin's remarks?
The relationship between President Putin and wealthy businessmen may be significantly impacted by Prigozhin's rebellion and remarks. Prigozhin's open criticism of the Russian government and military leadership, including President Putin, challenges the president's image of strong leadership. It raises questions about Putin's ability to maintain control over influential businessmen and suggests a perceived weakness in his leadership. This could lead to a loss of trust and support from other wealthy businessmen who may question their own relationship with Putin. Furthermore, Prigozhin's rebellion indicates a possible shift in the balance of power between the government and powerful oligarchs. It signals that some businessmen are willing to openly challenge the government and may embolden others to do the same. This could potentially lead to a strained relationship between President Putin and wealthy businessmen, with implications for economic policies, business investments, and political alliances.
