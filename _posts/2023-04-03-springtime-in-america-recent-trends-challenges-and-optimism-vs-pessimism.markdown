# Springtime in America: Recent Trends, Challenges, and Optimism vs Pessimism

## Introduction
Springtime in America brings many fine traditions. One of the biggest determinants of the global economic outlook is the spring selling season. The American housing market serves as a bellwether of the economy's performance amid rising interest rates. The property market is one of the earliest and largest sectors to react to changes.

## Recent Trends
New-home sales jumped in January to a ten-month high. Surveys gauging the confidence of both homebuilders and homebuyers have improved. The U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development release monthly data on new residential sales. The months' supply is a statistic that provides an indication of the size of the new for-sale inventory in relation to the number of new houses currently being sold. The months' supply indicates how long the current new for-sale inventory would last given the current sales rate if no additional new houses were built.

## Optimism vs Pessimism
The case for optimism is that America's property market has found a floor. Buyers are returning but the covid-era frenzy is not. A decent spring season could, in theory, allow prices to stabilize and builders to resume construction, boosting growth without stoking inflation. The case for pessimism rests on the idea that the interaction between the property market and inflationary trends is too powerful to ignore. If buyers return to a supply-constrained housing market, price rises will follow. If the Fed sees that such a rate-sensitive sector as property is not responding to tighter monetary policy, it may judge that it needs to be more hawkish.

## Discounts and Financial Engineering
Securitization is the process of taking a group of income-producing assets and turning them into a single product that can be invested in. The securitization of mortgages, known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS), is a classic example of securitization. Securitization enables lenders to underwrite more loans and investors to get in on the action. It promotes liquidity and access to credit, although the reputation of securitization did take a hit following the 2007ï¿½08 financial crisis. Securitization has been accused of encouraging reckless borrowing and triggering one of the worst financial crises on record. Securitization has been criticized for encouraging banks and other lenders to not care about the quality of the loans that they underwrite.

## Challenges
The financial system is being stressed by rapidly rising interest rates, which is causing banks to teeter and markets to seesaw. The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have put the precariousness of lenders in stark relief. Banks are facing growing unrealized losses due to large losses in their bond portfolios, which turn into real losses if the banks have to sell the assets. U.S. banks were facing more than $600 billion of unrealized losses because of rising rates at the end of last year, according to federal regulators. Midsize banks like Silicon Valley Bank do not have the same regulatory oversight as the nation's biggest banks, who are subject to tougher requirements to have a certain amount of reserves in moments of crisis.

## Conclusion
The Ohio housing marketplace experienced a slowdown in sales activity in February 2023. Despite the slowdown in sales, the average home price in Ohio continued to rise in February 2023. Rising interest rates contributed to the slower sales activity in Ohio's housing market. The inventory of homes being marketed for sale has begun to increase in many Ohio markets. Two local markets in Ohio showed an increase or were unchanged in sales activity compared to a year ago.
