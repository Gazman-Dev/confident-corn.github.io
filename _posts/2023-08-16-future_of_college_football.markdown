## How will the expansion of the College Football Playoff to 12 teams affect the selection process and ranking of teams?
The expansion of the College Football Playoff to 12 teams will greatly affect the selection process and ranking of teams. With more teams involved, there will be a need for a more comprehensive ranking system that takes into account various factors such as strength of schedule, head-to-head matchups, and overall performance. The selection committee will have a challenging task in determining the top teams and assigning seeds for the playoffs. Additionally, the expanded playoff format will likely lead to more debate and controversy over which teams deserve to be included. This could result in increased scrutiny of the selection committee's decisions and potentially changes to the selection process in the future.

## What impact will the conference realignment have on the power balance of conferences and the competitiveness of college football?
The conference realignment in college football will have a significant impact on the power balance of conferences and the competitiveness of the sport. The shifts in conference affiliations will create new rivalries and matchups, as well as potentially strengthen certain conferences while weakening others. The SEC and Big Ten conferences, with the addition of powerhouse programs like Oklahoma, Texas, USC, and UCLA, are expected to become even more dominant and competitive. This could lead to a concentration of power in a few conferences, making it more challenging for teams from smaller conferences to compete at the highest level. However, it could also create opportunities for smaller conferences to rise and establish themselves as strong competitors. Overall, the conference realignment will reshape the college football landscape and create new dynamics in terms of conference strength and competitiveness.

## How will the increased autonomy for schools in the top five conferences change the landscape of college sports and the benefits provided to athletes?
The increased autonomy for schools in the top five conferences will significantly change the landscape of college sports and the benefits provided to athletes. With the ability to write their own rules, these schools will have more control over various aspects of college sports, including player benefits, recruitment practices, and staff sizes. This could result in greater financial support for athletes, such as increased cost-of-attendance stipends and insurance benefits. It could also lead to more lenient recruiting rules and better resources for athletes to excel in their respective sports. However, the increased autonomy could also widen the gap between the power conferences and smaller schools, both in terms of resources and competitiveness. It will be crucial for the NCAA to ensure that there are safeguards in place to prevent any potential exploitation of athletes or further inequality in college sports. Overall, the increased autonomy for schools in the top five conferences will bring about significant changes in college sports and the benefits provided to athletes.

<p>The recent realignment shifts in college football, particularly the Pac-12 losing its biggest football brands, have led to discussions about potential changes to the College Football Playoff format.</p>
<p>The College Football Playoff board of managers has voted to expand the CFP to 12 teams and hopes to implement it as early as 2024. The expansion includes the six highest-ranked conference champions and six at-large teams. The rankings will still be determined by the CFP selection committee, and the format will include first-round byes for the top four conference champions. The quarterfinals, semifinals, and championship game will be played in bowl games and at a neutral site. The major holdup for expansion was objections from the ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-12 conferences, but some of those objections have been resolved. The presidents and chancellors have taken control of the decision-making process, and the commissioners will work on the logistics of implementing the expansion.</p>
<p>The College Football Playoff will expand to 12 teams in the 2024 and 2025 seasons. The Rose Bowl had to relinquish its request for a guaranteed time slot in the new contract. The format will consist of the selection committee's six highest-ranked conference champions and the next six highest-ranked teams. The quarterfinals and semifinals will be played in bowls on a rotating basis, and the national championship games will be held in Atlanta and Miami. Conference realignment may be affected by the new format, and the SEC and Big Ten conferences are expected to benefit the most. The Group of 5 conferences will have guaranteed access to the playoff, and Notre Dame will have increased access. The next contract length and format may be subject to change.</p>
<p>The College Football Playoff's board of managers unanimously voted to expand the CFP to 12 teams in 2026. The board encourages the sport's commissioners to implement the expansion as early as 2024. The 12-team format includes the six highest-ranked conference champions and six at-large teams. The rankings of the teams will continue to be determined by the CFP selection committee. The four highest-ranked conference champions will receive a first-round bye. Teams seeded five through 12 will play each other in the first round. The quarterfinals and semifinals will be played in bowl games on a rotating basis. The championship game will be held at a neutral site. The 12-team model was originally proposed by SEC commissioner Greg Sankey. The major holdup for expansion was objections from the ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-12 conferences. The objections began to fade after USC and UCLA joined the Big Ten. The Pac-12 and Big Ten are now in favor of CFP expansion. The presidents and chancellors took control of the decision-making process. The commissioners will continue to work on the logistics of implementing the expansion. Money can be a motivating factor for the expansion. The goal of the expansion is to provide more opportunities for teams to participate in the national championship.</p>
<p>Conference realignment moves for Power 5 and Group of 5 schools over the next two seasons. Colorado, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah have decided to join the Big 12 in 2024. Oregon and Washington are heading to the Big Ten in 2024. USC, UCLA, Oregon, and Washington will join the Big Ten in 2024. Oklahoma and Texas will join the SEC in 2024. Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF will leave the AAC and join the Big 12 in 2023. Charlotte, FAU, North Texas, Rice, UAB, and UTSA are leaving Conference USA and joining the AAC in 2023. Marshall, Old Dominion, and Southern Miss left Conference USA for the Sun Belt in 2022. Kennesaw State will join Conference USA in 2024. James Madison joined the Sun Belt in 2022. There are no plans for expansion or contraction in the ACC, Big Ten, Mountain West, MAC, or Sun Belt conferences.</p>
<p>The NCAA Division I board of directors has voted to allow schools in the top five conferences to write their own rules, giving them more autonomy and control over various aspects of college sports. The autonomy measures will permit the power conferences to decide on things such as cost-of-attendance stipends and insurance benefits for players, staff sizes, recruiting rules, and mandatory hours spent on individual sports. The top 64 schools in the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, SEC, and Pac-12, plus Notre Dame, can submit their own legislation and have it enacted. The new rules proposed under autonomy aim to give athletes more benefits and address legal challenges faced by the NCAA. The power conferences will also carry more voting power on general NCAA matters. Major conferences will still have to agree on issues, with a rule requiring either a 60 percent majority of the panel plus three of the power conferences or a simple majority plus four of the five leagues. The most powerful schools in Division I now have a chance to figure things out for themselves and potentially give more back to their players.</p>
<p>The College Football Playoff is set to undergo significant changes in the coming years with expansion to 12 teams and the impact of conference realignment. The new format will provide more opportunities for teams to compete for the national championship, while conference shifts will shape the landscape of college football. With the added autonomy for power conferences, the NCAA is adapting to the changing landscape of college sports. These developments will undoubtedly have a long-lasting impact on the future of college football and the broader landscape of college athletics.</p>
