In an effort to address illegal crossings and mitigate the risk of drowning, Texas has installed a floating barrier on the Rio Grande near the city of Eagle Pass. The barrier, made up of four-foot-wide buoys, spans 1,000 feet and serves as an additional layer of border security.

The body of a migrant was recently discovered along the floating barrier, highlighting the dangers faced by those attempting to cross the border. This tragic incident occurred on the Texas side of the border, near the newly implemented floating barrier.

The floating barrier is part of Governor Greg Abbott's plan to hinder migrants from crossing into Texas. The decision to install the barrier comes in response to the alarming rise in migrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border. In the past 12 months alone, at least 853 migrants have died while attempting to cross the border unlawfully.

Customs and Border Protection has reported a sharp increase in the number of rescues and life-saving operations for distressed migrants. Human smugglers, seeking profit, are endangering the lives of migrants by leading them on perilous journeys. These journeys involve crossing the treacherous Rio Grande, enduring extreme heat in the desert, and attempting to scale border barriers.

Title 42, a U.S. policy, has been criticized for pushing migrants to take more dangerous routes. Desperate to escape poverty, joblessness, and violence in their home countries, migrants are willing to embark on these perilous journeys.

The floating barrier in Eagle Pass aims to deter large groups of migrants from reaching Texas. It will strategically be deployed in migrant crossing hotspots, with the possibility of expansion in the future based on the threat.

The U.S. Border Patrol has already reviewed, designed, and tested the floating barrier, while the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission is examining Texas' proposal and its impact on international agreements.

Governor Abbott's plan to install the floating barrier includes a stretch of buoys that will act as a deterrent for migrants. Passing through the buoys is still possible, but with great effort.

The decision to implement the floating barrier near Eagle Pass is significant, as it is already a heavily fortified section of the border. Texas aims to slow down and deter as many migrants as possible by placing the barrier in this strategic location.

The installation of the floating barrier reflects Texas' commitment to border security and addressing the humanitarian crisis at the border. By implementing proactive measures like the floating barrier, Texas hopes to save lives and prevent unauthorized crossings into the state.

It is important to note that while the floating barrier provides an additional layer of security, comprehensive immigration reform and addressing the root causes of migration are crucial in finding long-term solutions to the complex issue of migration.
