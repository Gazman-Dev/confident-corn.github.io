## How has the role of the National Guard evolved in responding to disasters?
The role of the National Guard in responding to disasters has evolved significantly over the years. In the past, their primary role was to provide a military response in times of war or civil unrest. However, they now play a crucial role in disaster response and recovery efforts. They work hand-in-hand with civilian authorities to provide immediate assistance to affected communities, including clearing roads, rescuing stranded individuals, and providing security. Their specialized training and equipment, such as tactical vehicles and search and rescue capabilities, allow them to effectively respond to a wide range of disasters, including floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. The National Guard's involvement in disaster response has become essential in mitigating the impact of disasters and saving lives.

## What is the significance of the recently signed Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce (CREW) Act?
The recently signed Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce (CREW) Act has significant significance in strengthening the support system for disaster response and recovery. This act provides employment and reemployment rights for FEMA Reservists, ensuring that they have the same employment protections as military reservists and other emergency response personnel. This is crucial because FEMA Reservists play a vital role in disaster operations, providing on-call assistance to disaster survivors and first responders. With the CREW Act, these Reservists can now be assured of job security and protections while deployed to disasters and emergencies. This not only incentivizes individuals to join the FEMA Reservist program but also ensures continuity and stability in the workforce, leading to more effective and efficient disaster response efforts.

## How does the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) promote community recovery and resilience?
The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) is an essential tool in promoting community recovery and resilience after a disaster. It provides a coordinated and structured approach to recovery, ensuring that all stakeholders are involved in the process. One of the key ways the NDRF promotes community recovery is through its principles of restoring, redeveloping, and revitalizing communities. By focusing on these principles, the NDRF encourages communities to rebuild in a way that is more resilient to future disasters. It also emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration among stakeholders, ensuring that all recovery efforts are cohesive and aligned. The NDRF's Recovery Support Functions (RSFs) further contribute to community recovery by addressing key areas such as infrastructure, economic recovery, and health and social services. By bringing together federal departments, agencies, and organizations under these RSFs, the NDRF facilitates the coordination of resources and accelerates the recovery process. Overall, the NDRF plays a crucial role in guiding and supporting communities in their journey towards recovery and resilience.

        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>While driving through the disaster zone with a volunteer relief worker, we noticed uniformed soldiers at some of the checkpoints. This is the first sighting of soldiers in the area, which suggests that national assistance is now starting to arrive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in another part of the country, a severe winter storm in Texas caused massive power outages in February 2021. The deployment of the National Guard was crucial in response to the winter storm. National Guard members cleared roads and assisted stranded drivers, bringing Texans to warming shelters. Their collaboration with civilian authorities was commendable, as they worked together to strengthen and expand local disaster response capacity.</p>
<p>Not only are the National Guard involved in responding to natural disasters, but they also play a vital role in saving lives and protecting property during human-made disasters. Their swift water rescues and use of tactical vehicles in flood situations have been instrumental in mitigating the impact of such calamities. Their airlift missions in response to hurricanes have allowed for large-scale evacuation plans to be executed efficiently.</p>
<p>In addition to the National Guard, FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) consistently seeks talented and hard-working individuals who are eager to assist disaster survivors and first responders on an on-call basis as Reservist employees. Reservists travel, receive training, build professional networks, and support those in need. The work is available intermittently, and applicants must commit to working on an on-call basis, being available to travel within 24-48 hours and being deployed for 30 or more days.</p>
<p>The recently signed Civilian Reservist Emergency Workforce (CREW) Act provides employment and reemployment rights for FEMA Reservists when they are deployed to disasters and emergencies on behalf of FEMA. This legislation ensures that they have the same protections as military reservists, national guard members, national disaster medical service, and urban search and rescue system members. FEMA is in the process of implementing this important legislation to protect the full-time employment of Reservists.</p>
<p>FEMA, with its thousands of staff deployed to disaster operations across the country and U.S. territories, also maintains a cadre of more than 4,000 reservists. Their resources and current information about major disaster declarations can be found on their website, providing valuable support to those affected by disasters.</p>
<p>To facilitate effective recovery support to disaster-impacted states, tribes, territorial, and local jurisdictions, the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) was established. The NDRF focuses on restoring, redeveloping, and revitalizing communities in a way that builds a more resilient nation. It defines eight principles that guide recovery core capability development and recovery support activities.</p>
<p>The NDRF outlines a coordinating structure that ensures communication and collaboration among all stakeholders, provides guidance for pre- and post-disaster recovery planning, and assigns roles and responsibilities to recovery coordinators and other stakeholders. It promotes the opportunity to rebuild stronger, smarter, and safer communities.</p>
<p>Six Recovery Support Functions (RSFs) have been identified within the NDRF as the coordinating structure for key areas of recovery assistance. These include Infrastructure Systems, Economic Recovery, Natural &amp; Cultural Resources, Health and Social Services, Community Assistance, and Housing Recovery. The RSFs bring federal departments, agencies, and supporting organizations together to focus on community recovery needs and facilitate the coordination of resources to accelerate the recovery process.</p>
<p>The Recovery Support Function Leadership Group (RSFLG) plays a crucial role in coordinating disaster recovery work across the RSFs and prioritizing resources to support recovery efforts effectively. This group ensures that federal assistance is delivered in a unified and coordinated manner.</p>
<p>Overall, the collaborative efforts of uniformed soldiers, the National Guard, FEMA Reservists, and the National Disaster Recovery Framework demonstrate the commitment to providing timely and comprehensive assistance to disaster-affected communities. Their dedication to saving lives, protecting property, and supporting recovery efforts is commendable. Together, they form a strong and resilient support system that helps communities overcome the challenges posed by natural and human-made disasters.</p>
