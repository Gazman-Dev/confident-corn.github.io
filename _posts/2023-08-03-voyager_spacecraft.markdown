The Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977 to explore distant planets, continue to amaze scientists with their incredible journey through interstellar space. Voyager 1 holds the record as NASA's most distant spacecraft, while its twin spacecraft, Voyager 2, has recently made some exciting discoveries.

Last month, communication with Voyager 2 was temporarily lost due to a wrong command. However, during a routine scan of the sky, NASA picked up a carrier signal from the probe, indicating that it is still operational. Efforts are now underway to reestablish full communication by turning Voyager 2's antenna back toward Earth.

Meanwhile, Voyager 1 continues to operate normally and has provided valuable data on the boundary between our solar system and interstellar space.

In a series of five papers recently published, scientists analyzed Voyager 2's data and confirmed earlier findings from Voyager 1. These findings reveal that the boundary between our solar system and interstellar space is complex and ever-shifting. The heliopause, the boundary between the sun's emissions and the galaxy's particles, inflates and deflates like a balloon. Surprisingly, some of the sun's particles are able to punch through the heliopause and enter the space between stars.

Both Voyager spacecraft have entered interstellar space, with Voyager 1 reaching this milestone in 2012 and Voyager 2 following suit in 2018. Interstellar space begins at the heliopause, located just over 18 billion kilometers from the sun. These spacecraft have provided us with stunning images and invaluable data on the mixing and mingling of particles in this vast expanse.

One of the most iconic images captured by Voyager 1 is the "Pale Blue Dot" image, showing Earth as a tiny speck in the vastness of space. The Voyager spacecraft also carry golden records affixed to their sides, containing a message from Jimmy Carter and a selection of images, sounds, greetings, and music that represent humanity and our place in the universe.

The longevity of the Voyager spacecraft has surpassed all expectations. They continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge and reveal the wonders of interstellar space. As mission scientists analyze the data and make new discoveries, we are reminded of the incredible achievements of these pioneering spacecraft.

The Voyager missions are an integral part of the NASA Heliophysics System Observatory, providing us with a deeper understanding of our solar system and beyond. We eagerly await further updates from these remarkable voyagers as they continue their journey into the unknown.
