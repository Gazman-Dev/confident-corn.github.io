When it comes to creating a memorable TV show, the setting plays a vital role in enhancing the storytelling and captivating the audience. From picturesque landscapes to iconic landmarks, the selection of the right location can make a series truly extraordinary. Let's dive into some visually stunning and significant locations used in popular TV shows, highlighting the challenges faced during the filming process.

In Apple TV+'s 'Shrinking,' the Altadena Craftsman serves as the home of grieving therapist Jimmy. The California prisons, including the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi and the Stark Youth Training Facility in Chino, become the backdrop for HBO's 'Barry.' FX's 'The Old Man' features the downtown L.A. high rise where covert-agent-on-the-lam Dan Chase lives. The majestic locations in Norway set the stage for the confab between the Roy siblings and Swedish tech mogul Lukas Matsson in the final season of HBO's 'Succession.'

One of the most impressive location recreations took place for Hulu's 'Welcome to Chippendales.' The series showcases a re-creation of 1970s/80s Los Angeles and features a gaudy mansion close to the soundstages in Chatsworth. Scenes set in London, Switzerland, and India were shot in or around Los Angeles, including the rooftop restaurant at the Beverly Hilton Hotel transformed back in time for a tense dinner.

These remarkable settings were not without challenges. Filming often faced adverse weather conditions and unexpected location changes. However, the resilience of the production teams shone through, resulting in visually stunning and unforgettable TV moments.

Moving on to some extra sources, the TV show 'Ted Lasso' takes viewers to The Crown and Anchor pub in London's Richmond borough. The Belnord apartment building in New York City becomes a focal point in 'Only Murders in the Building.' 'Stranger Things' features Building A on Emory University's Briarcliff Campus, while 'The White Lotus' showcases the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea in Hawaii. The Bell Works office complex in New Jersey sets the stage for the TV show 'Severance,' and the Westview Abbey mausoleum in Atlanta plays a part in 'Ozark.'

But it's not just fictional TV shows that utilize captivating locations. The hit reality show 'Alone' takes contestants to wild and remote filming locations that truly test their limits. From the farthest reaches of Northern Canada to the southernmost point of South America, contenders face mental and physical challenges in their quest to emerge victorious. Previous seasons were filmed in various locations in Canada, as well as Patagonia, Argentina, and Northern Mongolia. The scouting process for new locations is meticulous, with factors such as remoteness, emergency unit response, natural resources, and local laws taken into consideration.

Lastly, let's not forget the significant role Memphis has played in the world of TV shows. NBC's 'Bluff City Law' showcases the vibrant city, with prominent local attractions and historic sites taking center stage. The National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel, Clayborn Temple, and I Am A Man Plaza are highlighted, along with scenes filmed at Sun Studio. The series also captures the essence of Memphis' civil rights history and iconic landmarks, including the Big River Crossing and the Hernando de Soto Bridge. The downtown Memphis skyline, along with vantage points at Beale Street Landing, River Garden, Mud Island River Park, riverboat cruises, and hotel rooftops, offers a breathtaking backdrop for this captivating series.

In conclusion, the selection of visually stunning locations adds depth and excitement to our favorite TV shows. Whether it's through fictional or real-life settings, these locations become characters in their own right, shaping the narratives and enhancing our viewing experience. The challenges faced during the filming process only add to the allure and appreciation of the remarkable work put into creating these long-reach and exciting stories.
