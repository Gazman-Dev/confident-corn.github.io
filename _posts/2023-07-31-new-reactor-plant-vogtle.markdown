A new reactor at Plant Vogtle in Georgia has entered commercial operation, marking the first new American reactor built from scratch in decades. The reactor, Unit 3, is capable of providing electricity to 500,000 homes and businesses at its full output of 1,100 megawatts.

Utilities in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama will receive the electricity. The completion of Unit 3 brings the project closer to the addition of Unit 4, which is expected to enter commercial operation by March.

The Vogtle project aims to contribute to clean energy generation and mitigate climate change. However, the project's costs have significantly increased, and Georgia Power's customers will have to bear the financial burden.

Additional events related to the status, delays, costs, and impacts of the Plant Vogtle nuclear reactor expansion in Georgia include:

1. Georgia Power announces that a new nuclear reactor at Plant Vogtle is on its way to becoming fully operational.
2. Southern Nuclear turns over inspections, tests, and analyses to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for regulatory approval.
3. Vogtle's third reactor unit is delayed for another month.
4. Georgia Power is awaiting formal approval to start loading fuel into Unit 4.
5. Georgia Power announces three-month delay for Unit 3 and 4.
6. Unit 3 begins loading nuclear fuel for the first time.
7. Georgia Power announces a one-month delay to Unit 3 reactor.
8. Georgia Power submits inspections, tests, and analyses to nuclear regulators for Unit 4.
9. Georgia's Public Service Commission to hold a monitoring hearing for Plant Vogtle expansion.
10. Concerns about the cost of the project and its impact on ratepayers.
11. Estimates of the cost overruns and how they will be split between ratepayers and shareholders.
12. Potential impact on utility bills for Georgia Power customers.

Georgia Power received the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for Vogtle Unit 4. The finding confirms that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations.

No further NRC findings are necessary to load fuel or begin the startup sequence for the new unit. Unit 4 has satisfied 364 required inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria.

The submission of documentation and targeted inspections were conducted before issuing the 103(g) finding.

The team is making final preparations for Unit 4 fuel load and startup testing. The unit will undergo several months of startup testing and operations.
