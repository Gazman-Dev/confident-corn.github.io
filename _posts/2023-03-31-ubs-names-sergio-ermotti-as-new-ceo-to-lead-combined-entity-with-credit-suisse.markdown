UBS Names Sergio Ermotti as New CEO to Lead Combined Entity with Credit Suisse

Zurich, Switzerland - In a major shake-up in the Swiss banking industry, UBS has announced that Sergio Ermotti will be the new CEO of the bank, replacing Ralph Hamers from April 5. The appointment comes as UBS successfully completes its acquisition of Credit Suisse, a move that has created new priorities for the board and the new CEO.

UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher praised Hamers' tenure and his instrumental role in delivering the Credit Suisse deal. "We are grateful for Ralph's leadership during this critical time in our history," Kelleher said. "His vision and strategic guidance have been instrumental in bringing UBS and Credit Suisse together, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors."

Ermotti's experience in picking up UBS after the 2008 financial crisis makes him uniquely qualified to lead the new combined entity. He transformed UBS by putting the firm's global wealth management business and Swiss universal bank at its core and cutting the investment bank's footprint.

The acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS follows years of losses and scandals for the bank. Credit Suisse's emergency sale to UBS was necessary to restore confidence in the bank and the Swiss financial system. Ermotti's task of integrating Credit Suisse into UBS is essential for both banks' clients, people, investors, Switzerland, and the global financial system.

Ermotti inherited an ailing investment bank that had been forced to write off more than $50 billion during the great financial crisis. However, he managed to turn things around and transform UBS into a leaner, more efficient bank.

In an interview with CNBC, Ermotti confirmed that he will be in the role for as long as they want him and emphasized that the bank wants to take away uncertainty as soon as they can regarding its restructuring and prospective layoff plans. "We want to get this done quickly and efficiently, so that we can focus on serving our clients and delivering value to our shareholders," he said.

Ermotti leaves his post as chairman of Swiss Re to take the reins at the new combined Swiss banking behemoth. He brings with him a wealth of experience and a proven track record of success in the financial industry.

The new UBS will be a force to be reckoned with in the global financial industry, with a strong presence in wealth management, investment banking, and asset management. The bank will also be well-positioned to weather any future economic storms, thanks to Ermotti's leadership and strategic vision.

The acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is a bold move that demonstrates the bank's commitment to growth and innovation. By combining forces, UBS and Credit Suisse will be able to better serve their clients and create value for shareholders, while also strengthening the Swiss financial system and the global economy.

As Ermotti takes the helm at UBS, he will face many challenges, but he is well-prepared to meet them head-on. With his experience, leadership, and vision, he is the right person to lead the bank into a new era of growth and prosperity. The future of UBS looks bright, and investors, clients, and employees can rest assured that they are in good hands with Sergio Ermotti at the helm.
