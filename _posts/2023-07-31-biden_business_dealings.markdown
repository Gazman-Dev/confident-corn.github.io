The Biden family's international business dealings have been a topic of controversy and speculation for years. With allegations of wrongdoing in China and Ukraine, accusations of influence-peddling and conflicts of interest, and ongoing investigations by the Justice Department, the story continues to unfold.

One key figure in this saga is Devon Archer, who served alongside Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, during Joe Biden's vice presidency. Recently, Archer testified about calls between President Biden and Hunter Biden during a House Oversight Committee hearing. Republicans argue that the calls were related to business dealings and that President Biden brought value to the companies involved. On the other hand, Democrats claim that the calls were casual conversations and did not involve any business transactions. The White House denies any involvement by President Biden in his son's business ventures.

But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Additional sources have revealed a multitude of events and allegations surrounding the Biden family's international business activities.

Hunter Biden, in particular, has faced scrutiny over his finances and business dealings in China. The Justice Department is currently investigating his financial affairs, including allegations of a $10 million annual fee from a Chinese billionaire and his involvement in the BHR Partners private equity fund in China. There are also alleged emails suggesting that Hunter Biden invited a Ukrainian energy company adviser to meet his father, raising questions of potential conflicts of interest.

Furthermore, Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden, has confirmed that Hunter frequently sought advice and sign-off from Joe Biden on potential deals in China. This raises concerns about the extent of Joe Biden's involvement in his son's business affairs, especially considering the alleged bribery scheme involving Burisma's owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.

The allegations against the Bidens have been met with counter accusations. President Trump and his children, as well as other politicians, have also been accused of influence-peddling and conflicts of interest. However, no criminal activity has been proven against the Bidens or Burisma.

As this complex story continues to evolve, it is crucial for the public to have access to all relevant information. Senator Chuck Grassley has called for transparency, urging the Biden Justice Department and FBI to show their work and investigate the allegations brought forward in the 1023 document, which allegedly contains evidence of a bribery scheme involving Vice President Biden and Hunter Biden. Grassley emphasizes the importance of Congress asserting its oversight powers and making the 1023 public without unnecessary redactions.

In the midst of these investigations and allegations, Devon Archer's upcoming appearance before the House Oversight Committee holds significant weight. Republicans view Archer as a key witness in their investigation into the Biden family's business deals. While no evidence has emerged linking President Biden's decisions to his son's business ventures, Republicans are expected to use the closed-door sit-down with Archer to try to support their investigative claims.

Meanwhile, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability is also actively investigating the Biden family's foreign business ventures. They have called on Mr. Vuk Jeremic to provide documents and records related to the Biden family's connection to a former CCP-connected business associate. The committee aims to examine President Biden's role in his family's foreign business deals and to determine whether national security has been compromised. This investigation may lead to legislation to strengthen federal ethics laws regarding public officials and their families.

The Biden family's international business dealings are far-reaching and have sparked a great deal of controversy and speculation. As the investigations continue and new information emerges, it is crucial for the public to stay informed about the potential implications and outcomes of these allegations. Transparency and accountability are paramount in maintaining the trust of the American people.
