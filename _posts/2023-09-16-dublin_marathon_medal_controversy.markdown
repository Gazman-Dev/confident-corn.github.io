  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>The Dublin Marathon is facing controversy over the design of this year's marathon medal, which features a quote from poet W.B. Yeats that is believed to be misattributed. The quote, 'There are no strangers here; Only friends you haven't met yet,' has been engraved on the bottom of the silver medals as a tribute to Yeats on the 100th anniversary of his Nobel Prize for Literature.</p>
<p>However, experts from the Yeats Society Sligo have stated that there is no hard evidence that Yeats ever wrote or said those words. The quote has been widely circulated online, but there is no record of it in any of Yeats's works.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the organizers of the Dublin Marathon stand by their decision to include the quote on the medals. They believe that the quote reflects the values of the marathon, which is known as 'the friendly marathon' due to its incredible volunteer support and spectator turnout.</p>
<p>The misattribution of the quote to Yeats may be disappointing to some, but it has sparked a larger discussion about the influence of Yeats on Irish society and the enduring appeal of his poetry. Despite the misquote, the idea of thousands of people wearing the Yeats medal in the Dublin Marathon is seen as a wonderful and amazing tribute to the poet.</p>
<p>In response to the controversy, the director of the Yeats Society Sligo, Susan O'Keeffe, has expressed that the decision to feature the quote on the medal was made in good faith. She is delighted that Yeats, a national poet, will be shared with over 20,000 passionate participants.</p>
<p>While there may be no hard proof of Yeats's connection to the quote, it cannot be denied that he is an important figure in Irish literature and a symbol of national pride. Yeats's evocative and mystical poetry has captivated readers for decades, and his contributions to the Irish literary renaissance are undeniable.</p>
<p>The Dublin Marathon, despite the controversy, remains a highly anticipated event with 22,500 entries. The race will take place on October 29th, and it will be started by Olympic silver medalist John Treacy, who won the race in 1993.</p>
<p>In the end, the misattributed quote on the Dublin Marathon medal serves as a reminder of the enduring power of literature and the impact that poets like W.B. Yeats have on our collective imagination. While the controversy may overshadow the event, it is a testament to the importance of critical thinking and ensuring the accuracy of attributions in our celebrations of great literary figures.</p>
