Doctors are increasingly concerned about the negative health impact of e-cigarettes and are discouraging people from using them as a smoking cessation tool. New medical guidelines strongly discourage the use of e-cigarettes, particularly in those with chronic heart disease. Studies show that e-cigarettes can cause harm to the whole body, including a condition called EVALI. Doctors warn against the dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes, as it can be particularly harmful to blood vessels. A parent shares their child's harrowing experience with EVALI. Doctors recommend approved smoking cessation tools such as nicotine replacement therapy and medications. It's important to note that e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA as a smoking cessation tool.

In recent years, the use of e-cigarettes has surged, especially among young people. This trend is concerning, as the public health impact of e-cigarettes has not been thoroughly reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In fact, a federal judge recently ruled the FDA's decision to allow e-cigarettes on the market as illegal. The unregulated environment in which e-cigarettes are sold raises further concerns.

One of the leading brands in the e-cigarette market is JUUL, which holds three-quarters of the U.S. market share. JUUL has gained popularity among young people, partly due to its high nicotine content. The number of high schoolers and middle schoolers using e-cigarettes has significantly increased in recent years.

The health effects of e-cigarettes are still largely unknown. However, studies have shown that e-cigarettes can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and affect blood vessel function. The aerosol produced by e-cigarettes contains harmful and potentially harmful substances, including nicotine, ultrafine particles, flavoring chemicals, volatile organic compounds, cancer-causing chemicals, and heavy metals.

Despite being marketed as a smoking cessation tool, e-cigarettes have not been proven to be effective in helping individuals quit smoking. Instead, approved smoking cessation methods such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) have been shown to be more successful. CBT helps individuals identify their smoking triggers, develop alternative behaviors to replace smoking, set realistic goals, and create a structured quit plan. CBT equips people with practical tools to overcome challenges and maintain long-term success in quitting smoking.

It's time to recognize the dangers of e-cigarettes and take action to protect public health. Stricter regulations and comprehensive research are necessary to fully understand the long-term impact of e-cigarette use. In the meantime, individuals should rely on approved smoking cessation methods and consult with their healthcare providers for assistance in quitting smoking.
