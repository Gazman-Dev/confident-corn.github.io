## What are the irreversible consequences if proper measures are not taken to detect and remove radiological contamination in Japan?
If proper measures are not taken to detect and remove radiological contamination in Japan, there can be several irreversible consequences. Firstly, the contamination can spread and affect a larger area, leading to increased radiation exposure for both humans and wildlife. This can have severe health effects, including an increased risk of cancer and genetic mutations. Secondly, the contaminated water can seep into groundwater and contaminate drinking water sources, posing a long-term threat to public health. Thirdly, the environmental impact can be significant, with the contamination affecting ecosystems and biodiversity. This can disrupt the balance of natural habitats and have long-lasting effects on the environment. Lastly, the economic consequences can be substantial, as the contamination can result in the loss of agricultural and fisheries industries, tourism, and the overall reputation of the affected areas.

## How does MIT's method of shock electrodialysis help reduce contaminated water volume in nuclear power plants?
MIT's method of shock electrodialysis offers a potential solution to reducing contaminated water volume in nuclear power plants. The method works by effectively separating contaminants such as cobalt and cesium from water through the use of electrodialysis. When an electric shock is applied to the water, charged particles in the water are attracted to oppositely charged electrodes, causing them to move away from the water. This process effectively removes the contaminants from the water, allowing it to be reused in the reactor. By reducing the volume of contaminated water, this method helps mitigate the environmental and logistical challenges associated with storing and disposing of large amounts of contaminated water. It also offers a more sustainable approach by enabling the reuse of water, reducing the demand for fresh water resources.

## What steps is the Japanese Government taking to address concerns and involve the public and experts in the decision-making process?
The Japanese Government has taken several steps to address concerns and involve the public and experts in the decision-making process. Firstly, they have approved a Basic Policy on the Handling of ALPS Treated Water, which includes a thorough review of facility design and operation, as well as a radiological impact assessment. This policy aims to ensure minimal effects on the public and the environment. Secondly, the government has opened the report for public comments, allowing citizens to provide feedback and express their concerns. This promotes transparency and allows the public to have a voice in the decision-making process. Additionally, the feedback from IAEA experts and various stakeholders will be taken into consideration, ensuring that a wide range of perspectives are considered. By involving experts and the public, the Japanese Government is demonstrating its commitment to making informed decisions that prioritize the well-being of the population and the environment.

        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>Marine biologist Robert Richmond, a professor with the University of Hawaii, expressed concerns over Japan's ability to detect and remove radiological contamination during a recent interview. He warned of the irreversible consequences if proper measures are not taken.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, IAEA officials and international experts visited Japan from 14th to 18th February. The purpose of their visit was to conduct an IAEA's Safety Review on ALPS treated water at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS). Meetings were held with relevant ministries and TEPCO to discuss cooperation regarding the handling of the ALPS treated water. This visit was conducted under strict preventive measures against the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MIT has developed a method to reduce contaminated water volume in nuclear power plants. The method, which utilizes shock electrodialysis, effectively separates contaminants such as cobalt and cesium from water. The cleaned water can then be reused in the reactor, offering a potential solution to the issue of contaminated water. The system is affordable, scalable, and versatile, making it a promising development in the field.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, concerns regarding the environmental impact of the Fukushima accident persist. Radioactive fallout has spread across land and sea, particularly in the Fukushima prefecture. While many foodstuffs in Japan are now free of contamination, the water used for cooling the Fukushima reactors continues to be affected.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government has recently approved a Basic Policy on the Handling of ALPS Treated Water, which includes a thorough review of facility design and operation, as well as a radiological impact assessment. The government aims to ensure minimal effects on the public and the environment. To further improve the policy, the report is open for public comments, and necessary procedures for approval will follow. The feedback from IAEA experts and various stakeholders will also be taken into consideration. The Japanese Government is committed to providing scientific information in a transparent manner.</p>
<p>In conclusion, concerns regarding Japan's radiological impact assessment and the handling of ALPS treated water at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station have prompted international attention. With marine biologist Robert Richmond warning of the potential irreversible consequences, IAEA officials conducted a Safety Review and engaged in discussions to address the issue. MIT's method offers hope for reducing contaminated water volume in nuclear power plants. However, the environmental impact of the Fukushima accident remains a concern, particularly regarding the contamination of water used for cooling. The approval of the Basic Policy on the Handling of ALPS Treated Water demonstrates the Japanese Government's commitment to addressing these concerns and involving the public and experts in the decision-making process.</p>
