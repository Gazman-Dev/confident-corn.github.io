# Travel Nursing: A Booming Career Option with Pros and Cons

## Overview

Travel nursing is a popular career option for nurses who want to experience new places, earn higher pay, and have a flexible work schedule. However, this career path comes with its own set of challenges and downsides.

Here are some facts about travel nursing:

1. Travel nursing is a career option that offers higher pay than staff nursing due to high demand, with travel nurses making about 50% more on average.
2. Travel nurses receive living expense and housing stipends, which are considered reimbursements and not income, but they must follow rules to avoid paying taxes on the stipends.
3. Travel nursing comes with downsides such as being away from family and having unreliable health care, as travel nurses only have health insurance while under contract.
4. Travel nursing can be difficult in terms of combating burnout, as there may be a lack of supportive work environment and animosity from staff nurses who are paid less.
5. Travel nurses can combat burnout by choosing a hospital that is used to having travel nurses and building a good relationship with a travel company to create a support system.

## Tucker's Experience

Aspen Tucker is a travel nurse who has been working in this field since earning his associate's degree in 2020. Here are some facts about his experience:

1. Tucker earned $187,000 in 2022, yet works only 9 months out of the year.
2. Tucker left his South Carolina hospital job at the height of the pandemic to work as a travel nurse in Amarillo, Texas, after being offered $6,700 per week.
3. Tucker works between 48 and 60 hours per week to allow for time off and spends the rest of his time in his hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina, or vacationing.
4. Tucker warned that not every facility will feel friendly, especially when working with staff nurses who likely are getting paid a lot less.

## Travel Nurses' Pay and Guidelines

Travel nursing pay has been on the rise since the pandemic, with some states introducing legislation to cap agency nurse pay in an attempt to better balance the gap between staff and travel nurse pay. Here are some facts about travel nurses' pay and guidelines:

1. Travel nurse pay has increased significantly since the pandemic, with August 2021 numbers showing a weekly average rate of over $2.5K, compared to a December 2019 average weekly pay of just over $1K.
2. Some states have introduced legislation to cap agency nurse pay in an attempt to better balance the gap between staff and travel nurse pay.
3. The American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, LeadingAge, and a coalition of long-term care and senior living organizations sent a letter to White House officials warning against the "price gouging" happening in staffing agencies and how the practice is harmful to both patients and providers.
4. Pennsylvania Representative Timothy R. Bonner plans to introduce legislation that will establish maximum rates on agency healthcare personnel and require Contract Health Care Service Agencies to register with the Department of Human Services as a condition of their operations in Pennsylvania.
5. Travel nurses have expressed concern that wage caps could potentially put both patients and healthcare facilities at risk amidst another COVID-19 surge or even another health emergency.

In conclusion, travel nursing can be a lucrative and rewarding career option for nurses, but it also comes with its own set of challenges and downsides. It is important for nurses to weigh the pros and cons before deciding to pursue this career path.

# GPT Asks and Answers

**Q: How will the rise of travel nursing impact the healthcare industry in the long term?**

A: The demand for travel nurses is expected to continue to rise, particularly in rural areas and during times of crisis. This may lead to a shift away from traditional staff nursing positions and towards more flexible, temporary positions. However, it could also exacerbate existing staffing shortages and lead to increased competition for job opportunities.

**Q: What are some potential ethical concerns with the high pay offered to travel nurses compared to staff nurses?**

A: The large pay disparity between travel nurses and staff nurses could lead to feelings of resentment and frustration among staff nurses who may feel undervalued and underpaid. Additionally, the high pay offered to travel nurses may be seen as exploitative, particularly if they are being brought in to fill staffing gaps that could be addressed through better working conditions and pay for existing staff. This could ultimately contribute to a culture of burnout and high turnover in the healthcare industry. 

**Q: How might legislation to cap agency nurse pay impact the availability and quality of travel nursing positions?**

A: While capping agency nurse pay may help to address pay disparities and improve working conditions for staff nurses, it could also make travel nursing positions less desirable and lead to a decrease in the number of available positions. This could ultimately impact the quality of care provided in healthcare facilities that rely on travel nurses to fill staffing gaps. It's important to consider the potential unintended consequences of such legislation and to work towards finding solutions that address the root causes of staffing shortages and pay disparities in the healthcare industry.
