<p>Hulu's limited series Welcome to Chippendales premieres on Nov. 22. The series tells the true story behind the all-male revue founded by Somen 'Steve' Banerjee in 1980s Los Angeles. The story involves male strippers, jealousy, and murder. The series is based on the 2014 book, Deadly Dance: The Chippendales Murders. Kumail Nanjiani, Juliette Lewis, and Murray Bartlett star in the series. Banerjee was an Indian immigrant who bought a failing L.A. club in 1975 and later turned it into Chippendales. The idea to turn the club into a strip club for women came from club promoter Paul Snider. The shirtless Chippendale dancers wore bow tie collars and cuffs as a nod to Playboy bunnies. Banerjee hired Snider as Chippendales' first emcee but later replaced him. In 1980, Snider killed Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten and himself. Nick De Noia was a choreographer hired by Banerjee and they often clashed over the direction of the shows. De Noia later launched a successful Chippendales tour. Chippendales became a cultural phenomenon with calendars, TV appearances, and spoofs. Banerjee engaged in corrupt business practices and had rival nightclubs burned down. Chippendales filed for bankruptcy following a discrimination lawsuit in 1987. Banerjee became angry with De Noia for the tour's success and eventually had him killed in 1987. De Noia's murder went unsolved for years. Banerjee later attempted to have a former Chippendales dancer and choreographer killed, but the plot was foiled by the FBI. Banerjee was charged with murder for hire and other crimes and he entered into a plea agreement. Hours before his scheduled sentencing, Banerjee died by suicide. Chippendales survived the scandal and continues to be a popular male revue. Banerjee's son founded his own male revue called Strippendales.</p>
