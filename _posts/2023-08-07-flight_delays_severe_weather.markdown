Airports across the Eastern United States grounded numerous flights because of the threat of severe weather on Monday afternoon. The Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary ground stops for airports in major U.S. cities, including Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Reagan Washington National Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Dulles International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, La Guardia Airport, and Kennedy International Airport in New York.

As storms moved through Baltimore, New York, and Washington, flights were grounded and delayed, causing a ripple effect of delays across the country.

The severe weather system brought thunderstorms with high winds that resulted in power outages for more than one million homes and businesses. Tragically, there were two fatalities, one from a lightning strike and another from a falling tree. Tornado watches were issued for multiple states, and a tornado actually hit the village of McGraw in New York.

In addition to the storm system, there were multiple thunderstorm warnings and warnings for excessive rainfall across the region.

The storm system created a complex and active weather pattern that caused significant disruptions for airlines. In the last 6 months of 2021, flight cancellation rates outpaced rates from 2018 and 2019, despite a 14 percent decrease in scheduled flights. Flight delays remained at similar rates compared to previous years. Factors within airlines' control, such as aircraft maintenance and crew issues, were the primary cause of cancellations.

Airlines faced operational challenges in managing flight disruptions, including a need for additional pilots and crew. To address these challenges, airlines hired new staff, opened training facilities, and reduced the number of scheduled flights. However, these efforts were not always sufficient to accommodate affected passengers, leading to dissatisfaction among consumer advocate representatives.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have been actively engaged in addressing flight disruptions. They met with airlines to discuss customer service obligations and released the Airline Customer Service Dashboard, which provides information on the services and amenities airlines offer in the event of delays or cancellations. The DOT also monitors chronically delayed flights and analyzes system-wide cancellation and on-time performance data.

Flight disruptions have raised questions about airline scheduling practices and the enforcement of consumer protections by the DOT. As air travel began to recover from the pandemic in mid-2021, frequent flight disruptions affected millions of passengers. The DOT plans to continue its efforts to address these issues.

If your flight is delayed, there are several tips to keep in mind. Check in 24 hours in advance and travel with only a carry-on to skip check-in lines. Keep checking your flight status before heading to the airport and download the airline's application to track your flight. Federal law requires airlines to provide a full refund for significantly delayed flights. Check your airline's website for its contract of carriage, and if your flight is delayed, get in line to speak with a gate agent or call the airline's international numbers for shorter wait times. Finally, be aware of cellphone rates before making international calls.

Severe weather events like this one pose significant challenges for the aviation industry, but ongoing efforts by airlines and regulatory agencies aim to minimize disruptions and provide better customer service in the future.
