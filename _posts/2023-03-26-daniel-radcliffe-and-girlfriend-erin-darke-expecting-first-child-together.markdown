The couple, who have been in a relationship for over a decade, has kept the pregnancy a secret until now. A spokesperson for the 'Harry Potter' star confirmed the news, and an insider revealed that Radcliffe is excited to become a dad. The couple has been notoriously private, and this will be their first child together. They were last seen in public over a year ago, and their last red carpet appearance was eight years ago. The couple met on the set of the 2013 movie 'Kill Your Darlings', where they had a sex scene. Radcliffe has since joked that it will be a good story to tell their kids.

## AI predict: Daniel Radcliffe will find a way to balance fatherhood and his acting career
The couple will keep their child's life private and out of the spotlight, much like their own relationship. Radcliffe may have a difficult time balancing fatherhood and his busy acting career, but he will find a way to make it work.
