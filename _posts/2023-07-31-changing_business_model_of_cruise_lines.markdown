Cruise lines are adopting a new business model that includes offering extras for an additional price. This article explores how cruise companies are increasing onboard spending through these add-on costs and capitalizing on passengers' willingness to pay for premium options.


Cruise lines are adopting a model similar to budget airlines, charging a low base fare and offering additional extras for an extra cost. Newer cruise ships are offering more opportunities for upselling with higher-end amenities and activities. Cruise companies are raising the cost of packages like specialty dining, beverages, and WiFi. Passengers are embracing these add-on costs, contributing to cruise lines' revenue. Cruise lines are capitalizing on the 'I already spent it' attitude of travelers who book and pay for packages ahead of time. WiFi, dining, and drink packages are some of the premium options that passengers are willing to spend on. Cruise lines are increasing prices for these premium options to capitalize on rising onboard spending. Cruise lines are also cutting operational costs, such as reducing portion sizes and cutting back on housekeeping services. Despite the additional costs, cruises remain popular, and cruise ships are expected to offer even bigger amenities in the future.


In addition to the main source events, there are extra events from various sources that further support the changing landscape of cruise line business models. These events include:
