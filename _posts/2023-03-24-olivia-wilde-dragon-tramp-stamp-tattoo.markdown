Olivia Wilde has revealed the tattoo she has been hiding for 26 years, a dragon tramp stamp on her butt. She got the tattoo when she was 13, and it was her first tattoo. She has a bad tattoo club, and she thinks the dragon tattoo is now hideous. Wilde's other tattoos are not regrettable, as she has delicate designs of the Libra and Taurus constellations on her inner forearms, representing the signs of her daughter and son, respectively. She is planning to have another tattoo soon, probably on her chest. She shared a picture with Jennifer Coolidge and mentioned that she is moving the picture to the grid and then to a chest tattoo. 

## AI predict: The Dragon Tattoo will be trending again
The dragon tattoo is still trendy and popular among teenagers. People might start getting more dragon tattoos after Olivia Wilde's revelation.
