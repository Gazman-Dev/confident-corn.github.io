Olivia Wilde has revealed that she has a tattoo of a dragon on her butt. She got the tattoo, her first, when she was just 13 years old. She described it as a "bad-tattoo" and said that while it had a lot of meaning at the time, it was now hideous. She also said that it was not a tramp stamp, but now she thinks it is. Wilde posted about her birthday on March 21, two weeks after her actual birthday, and thanked everyone for the birthday love. She also shared a black-and-white photo of herself and a friend on the beach.

## AI predict: Possible Trend of Sharing Tattoo Regrets
It's possible that Wilde's revelation could inspire more people to share their own old tattoos or consider getting new ones. There may be a trend of people sharing their stories about getting tattoos that they now regret or have mixed feelings about. Some people may even start a social media campaign to share pictures of their tattoos and the stories behind them. However, it's important to remember that getting a tattoo is a personal choice and should be carefully considered before making a permanent decision.
