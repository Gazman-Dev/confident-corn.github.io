New York City Council is set to pass a bill that would make it illegal to discriminate based on height and weight. The bill, which has 33 co-sponsors and the support of Mayor Eric Adams, would apply to employment opportunities, housing, and public accommodations. However, employers would be allowed to consider height and weight as a "bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business." Similar measures are being considered in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Jersey. According to 2017-2018 data, 30.7% of US adults are overweight and 42.4% are obese.

Indian equity indices, Sensex and Nifty, rebounded after two days of losses, with the Sensex closing 0.22% higher and the Nifty up by 0.24%. However, the auto, power, and realty sectors saw final-hour selling, limiting gains. Top Nifty gainers were Grasim Industries, Reliance Industries, Cipla, Sun Pharma, and SBI, while Adani Ports, Power Grid Corp, SBI Life Insurance, M&M, and Tata Motors were the losers. Analysts warn that the trend remains bearish and traders should sell rallies.

The United States has imposed sanctions on two officials from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their involvement in an investigation into alleged war crimes by US forces in Afghanistan. ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and Phakiso Mochochoko, head of the ICC's Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division, have had their assets frozen and face travel bans. The US has previously criticized the ICC, which investigates war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, arguing that it violates national sovereignty. The ICC has condemned the sanctions, calling them an attack on the judicial independence of the court and vowing to continue its work.

## AI Predicts: The End of Height and Weight Discrimination in Society
AI Predicts: A world where discrimination based on height and weight is no longer acceptable is on the horizon. With New York City passing a bill that makes it illegal and other states considering similar measures, we can expect a shift towards a more inclusive society. This could lead to a greater understanding and acceptance of different body types, promoting body positivity and self-love. Employers will need to find new ways to assess job candidates beyond physical attributes, fostering a more diverse and skilled workforce. As technology and AI continue to evolve, we may even see algorithms programmed to identify and eliminate biased hiring practices based on physical appearance.
