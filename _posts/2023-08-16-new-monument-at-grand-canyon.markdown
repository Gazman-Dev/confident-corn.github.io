## What is the significance of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni monument in relation to Native American issues and the landback movement?
The significance of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni monument in relation to Native American issues and the landback movement is profound. This monument reflects the administration's commitment to Native American issues and the landback movement by protecting culturally and spiritually significant sites for the Indigenous peoples of the Southwest. It serves as a recognition of past injustices, particularly towards the Havasupai Tribe, who were driven out of their ancestral lands when the Grand Canyon National Park was established. By establishing this monument, President Biden is taking a step towards addressing these past injustices and ensuring the preservation of the Grand Canyon. It signifies the importance of honoring tribal sovereignty, advancing conservation initiatives, and protecting sacred Indigenous sites.

## What steps is President Biden taking to address past injustices and promote the preservation of the Grand Canyon?
President Biden is taking several steps to address past injustices and promote the preservation of the Grand Canyon. The creation of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni monument is one such step, as it recognizes the historical displacement of the Havasupai Tribe and preserves their cultural and sacred sites. Additionally, President Biden plans to provide national monument protections for the Avi Kwa Ame region in southern Nevada, which will further contribute to the preservation of wildlife, sacred Indigenous sites, and rural communities. Furthermore, the administration's allocation of $44 million for climate resilience projects in national parks demonstrates a commitment to protecting and preserving the environment. Through these actions, President Biden is working towards rectifying past injustices and ensuring the long-term preservation of the Grand Canyon and its surrounding areas.

## How will the establishment of the Avi Kwa Ame region as a national monument benefit wildlife, sacred Indigenous sites, and rural communities in southern Nevada?
The establishment of the Avi Kwa Ame region as a national monument will have several benefits for wildlife, sacred Indigenous sites, and rural communities in southern Nevada. The region holds sacred Indigenous sites and important migration pathways for wildlife. By designating it as a national monument, these sites and migration pathways will be protected, ensuring their preservation for future generations. The designation will also provide new opportunities for responsible recreation, allowing visitors to connect with and appreciate the region's natural beauty. Additionally, rural communities in southern Nevada will benefit from the economic development opportunities that come with responsible tourism. This designation will not only promote the conservation of Nevada's wildlife and sporting heritage but also contribute to the overall well-being of the region's wildlife, sacred sites, and rural communities.
