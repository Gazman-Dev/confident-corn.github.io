        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>In the world of music, there are few stories as remarkable as that of Sixto Diaz Rodriguez. Born on July 10, 1942, in Detroit, Michigan, Rodriguez's journey to international fame and recognition is one filled with intrigue, mystery, and extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>Rodriguez first burst onto the music scene in the late 1960s, releasing his debut single 'I'll Slip Away' under the name Rod Riguez. This Donovan-inspired track caught the attention of local producer Harry Balk, who recorded it for Impact Records. Balk then changed Rodriguez's name to Rod Riguez, setting the stage for what would become a legendary career.</p>
<p>Despite the early promise, Rodriguez's music failed to gain traction in the United States. His albums, 'Cold Fact' (1970) and 'Coming from Reality' (1971), received critical acclaim but struggled to find commercial success. Little did Rodriguez know that his music was making waves on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>It was in Australia that Rodriguez's music found an unexpected and devoted following. A handful of copies of his debut LP, 'Cold Fact,' made their way to Australia, where they fell into the hands of radio DJ Holger Brockman. Brockman, impressed by the enchanting sound of Rodriguez's music, began playing his song 'Sugar Man' on 2SM radio in Sydney. The response was overwhelming, and soon record stores across the continent were selling out of 'Cold Fact.' Rodriguez became a sensation in Australia, drawing crowds of thousands to his concerts.</p>
<p>But it was in South Africa that Rodriguez's music took on a whole new meaning. His soulful melodies and poignant lyrics resonated deeply with the South African people, who saw his music as a rallying cry against the oppressive apartheid regime. Rodriguez became the soundtrack to their lives, with his album 'Cold Fact' being hailed as one of the most famous records of all time in South Africa.</p>
<p>The story of Rodriguez's rise to fame in South Africa is as compelling as his music itself. For years, his whereabouts were shrouded in mystery, with fans desperate to find the man behind the music. Two men, Stephen Segerman and journalist Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, took it upon themselves to uncover the truth. Their tireless efforts paid off when they discovered that Rodriguez was living a quiet life as a laborer and office worker in Detroit. The news of Rodriguez's rediscovery spread like wildfire, and in 1998, he embarked on a triumphant tour of South Africa, playing sold-out shows to adoring fans.</p>
<p>Rodriguez's journey was not without its challenges. Despite his newfound fame, he remained humble and down-to-earth, living a simple life in the same modest Detroit house for over 40 years. He had no car, no computer, and no television. It wasn't until his daughter Regan insisted he get a cellphone that Rodriguez begrudgingly entered the modern age.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Rodriguez remained a true artist, dedicated to his craft and his fans. Despite his limited vision due to glaucoma, he continued to tour and perform, captivating audiences around the world. He always referred to his bands as 'covers of my own songs,' boasting a roster of notable musicians from various countries.</p>
<p>Today, Rodriguez's music continues to inspire and resonate with countless people across the globe. His story was immortalized in the Oscar-winning documentary 'Searching for Sugar Man,' which brought his music to a wider audience and solidified his place in music history.</p>
<p>Sadly, on August 8, 2023, Sixto Diaz Rodriguez passed away at the age of 81. His legacy, however, will live on forever. His music will continue to be cherished and celebrated, and his remarkable journey will serve as a testament to the power of perseverance, artistic brilliance, and the enduring impact of music.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Rodriguez. Your music will forever be the soundtrack to our lives.</p>
