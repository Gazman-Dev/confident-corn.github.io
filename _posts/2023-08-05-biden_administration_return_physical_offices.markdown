The Biden administration is taking a more forceful approach to ending remote work and encouraging federal workers to return to physical offices. This policy shift follows a pledge made by President Biden during his March 2022 State of the Union speech. The administration aims to improve team well-being and deliver better results for the American people.

Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg also supports the push for in-person work, citing the impact on customer service at federal agencies. Office vacancy rates in Washington DC have increased during the pandemic, indicating a need to fill physical office spaces.

U.S. Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) have introduced the Stopping Home Office Work's Unproductive Problems (SHOW UP) Act. This act requires all executive agencies to return to their pre-pandemic remote work policies. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will certify any expanded telework policies. Additionally, the SHOW UP Act requires federal agencies to return to 2019 telework levels within 30 days. Federal agencies must also submit studies to Congress within six months on how pandemic-era telework levels impacted their missions.

The SHOW UP Act prevents federal agencies from permanently expanding telework without certified telework plans. These plans must address improving agency mission performance, lowering real property and locality pay costs, ensuring network security, data and record security, and accelerating the dispersal of federal jobs nationwide. Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Steve Daines (R-MT) have joined Senators Cramer and Blackburn in supporting the SHOW UP Act. The companion legislation passed the House of Representatives on February 1, 2023, by a vote of 221-206.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has also released guidance on telework, including the definition of telework and remote work. The guidance provides information on initiating a remote work arrangement and granting remote work requests. It emphasizes the importance of accurate documentation of worksite and provides an overview of OPM's Remote Work Guide.

A survey of over 10,000 employees, including 500 government workers, found that 45% of government employees may look for a new job if their agency mandates returning to work in person. The survey revealed concerns about work/life balance, commute time, costs, and stress with more in-person work. Government leaders are advised to focus on flexibility and remote work options as employees value these benefits. According to a Workforce Report, hybrid work has been effective in addressing work/life balance and mental health issues. A successful hybrid work model includes visibility, connection, and flexibility.

Moreover, the Covid-19 lockdowns have shown that it is not only possible but perhaps preferable for knowledge workers to do their jobs from anywhere. Studies indicate that working from home yields numerous benefits for both individuals and organizations, such as enhanced productivity and engagement. However, challenges arise in communication, knowledge sharing, socialization, performance evaluation, security, and more when all or most employees are remote. Companies like GitLab, Tata Consultancy Services, and Zapier have set examples of best practices for successful work-from-anywhere policies.

As the Biden administration aims to bring federal workers back to physical offices, it is important to consider the value of flexibility and hybrid work models. While in-person work may have its advantages, remote work has proven beneficial for many employees and organizations. The SHOW UP Act provides a framework for a gradual return to pre-pandemic telework policies, balancing the need for in-person collaboration with the benefits of remote work. This balance will be crucial in shaping the future of work and ensuring the well-being and productivity of federal workers.
