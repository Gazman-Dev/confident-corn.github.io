Crypto enthusiasts around the world are eagerly awaiting news of the latest Ethereum upgrade, which is set to take place in Shanghai. The blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant has predicted that the upgrade will have little impact on the selling pressure of ETH, despite allowing validators to withdraw ETH from Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain for the first time.

Currently, 60% of all staked Ethereum is below the price it was purchased at, representing 10.3 million ETH at a loss equating to slightly over $16.86 billion. However, the risk of encountering high selling pressure is not currently a concern for staked ETH holders as they are not sitting on "extreme profits." This news has been met with a sigh of relief from many in the crypto community who were concerned about the potential impact of the upgrade.

Meanwhile, in other news, former FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has made a staggering political donation of over $74 million to politicians. CoinDesk revealed unusually close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund. In addition, 196 members of the new Congress received cash from Sam Bankman-Fried or other senior executives at FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy in November.

The regulatory actions against the crypto industry in the US seemed too well-sequenced to be coincidental, and the White House released a scathing report on the industry at the very same moment, one that reversed the open-minded executive order it produced a year ago. US industry leaders of all stripes have been warning of an exodus of crypto businesses due to the damage already done to the United States' prospects to attract crypto investment, entrepreneurship, and innovation. The impact of the collapse of FTX and the subsequent political donations could be profound. Many are now watching to see how this will impact the future of the crypto industry in the US.

# GPT asks and answers

## What is the potential impact of the FTX bankruptcy and political donations on the crypto industry in the US?

The collapse of FTX and the political donations made by its founder have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and regulatory oversight in the crypto industry. The close ties between FTX and Alameda Research have also come under scrutiny, with some questioning the transparency of their operations. This could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potentially stricter regulations for the industry in the US.

## How will the upcoming Ethereum upgrade in Shanghai affect staked ETH holders?

While there is always a risk of encountering high selling pressure during upgrades, the fact that most staked ETH holders are currently sitting on losses means that this is not a major concern at the moment. However, the upgrade could potentially lead to increased volatility in the market, so it is important for investors to remain vigilant and be prepared for any potential fluctuations in price.
