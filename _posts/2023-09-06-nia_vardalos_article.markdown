Nia Vardalos, the talented Canadian-born American actress, recently sat down with Condé Nast Traveler to share her love for Greece and her thrilling experiences during the filming of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3. Vardalos, who is of Greek descent, opened up about her connection to her heritage and the joy of exploring the picturesque island of Hydra.

In her interview, Vardalos revealed her packing strategy, which involves careful selection of dresses, shoes, and accessories to ensure she looks fabulous on her trips. She even shared a valuable hanger trick she learned from her stylist to keep her clothes organized in her suitcase.

As she reminisced about her time filming My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Vardalos couldn't help but mention her memorable experience flying in first class. It was during this trip that she truly felt the magic of the film and the deep connection to her Greek roots.

But Nia Vardalos's journey in the film industry goes beyond her iconic role in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Known for her talent as a writer and director, Vardalos has made significant contributions to American cinema.

With her debut film My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), Vardalos not only showcased her acting skills but also proved her writing prowess. The film earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

Throughout her career, Vardalos has continued to shine. She made her directorial debut in 2009 with the film I Hate Valentine's Day and collaborated with Tom Hanks to write the film Larry Crowne (2011). In addition, Vardalos adapted Cheryl Strayed's book Tiny Beautiful Things for the stage, showcasing her versatility as an artist.

It is worth noting that Vardalos's talent extends beyond the big screen. She has also made appearances in various television projects, including the ABC holiday film Same Time, Next Christmas (2019).

Life hasn't always been smooth sailing for Vardalos. She and her husband, Ian Gomez, faced a challenging time in 2018 when they filed for divorce after 23 years of marriage. However, their love and commitment to their daughter, Ilaria, whom they adopted in 2008, remain strong.

Nia Vardalos's dedication to her Greek heritage and her contributions to the film industry have left an indelible mark. Her portrayal of Greek Americans in My Big Fat Greek Wedding has not only entertained audiences but also shed light on the rich and vibrant culture of Greek America.

As Dan Georgakas, director of the Greek American Studies Project, shares, American films depicting Greek Americans reflect American cultural beliefs and reinforce cultural values. Through his unique filmography, Georgakas aims to explore how mainstream America perceives Greek Americans and how American cinema has reacted to that perception.

Georgakas's project has identified approximately 80 films featuring Greek American characters, with varying portrayals and stereotypes. From professional gamblers to wrestlers, the films often reflect the prevailing stereotypes of the time.

However, it is crucial to note that not all portrayals are negative. Several Greek Americans have had prominent careers in Hollywood, including Hermes Pan, Theoni Aldridge, Dean Tavoularis, Spyro Skouras, John Casavettes, Elia Kazan, A.I. Bezzerides, Telly Savalas, and more. In recent years, Greeks have often been presented as model ethnic Americans, promoting a positive image.

While American cinema may not have done much to promote Hellenic culture, independent films made by Greek Americans have provided more accurate portrayals of Greek America. These films offer a different perspective and shed light on the multifaceted nature of Greek American identity.

Speaking of perspectives, let's delve into the captivating island of Hydra, which played a significant role in Nia Vardalos's journey. Located less than two hours south of Athens by ferry, Hydra is a breathtaking destination known for its relaxed atmosphere and scenic beauty.

Donkeys serve as the main mode of transportation on the island, as there are no real roads or cars. Water taxis offer travelers the opportunity to explore isolated beaches and tavernas, creating a unique and idyllic experience.

Hydra's charm has attracted celebrities, tourists, artists, and writers throughout the years. One notable resident was Leonard Cohen, who drew inspiration from Hydra to write his iconic song 'Bird on the Wire.' The island's rich history is reflected in its old cannons, anchors, and small museums, including a historical museum and a shipping magnate's mansion.

The village of Kaminia, with its picturesque views and breathtaking sunset vistas, is a must-visit spot on the island. Strolling along the lit coastal lane, lined with windmills, and indulging in delicious pastries from the local shops are favorite pastimes of both locals and visitors.

Hydra's economy thrives on its connection to the sea. From the sponge divers of Florida to the beauty of Hydra's beaches, the island offers a unique experience that captivates the hearts of all who visit.

Finally, let's not forget the exciting news of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3. Filming for the highly anticipated third installment began on June 21, 2022, in Athens, Greece, and was completed on August 4, 2022. The film was shot in various locations across Greece, including Athens and the beautiful island of Corfu. Fans can expect to see the film released on September 8, 2023, in the United States.

Join Nia Vardalos on this incredible journey as she takes us through the vibrant world of Greek America and shares her love for Greece and the magic of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
