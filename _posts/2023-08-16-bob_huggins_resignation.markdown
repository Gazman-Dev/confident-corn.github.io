This code of conduct should be communicated to all members of the athletic department, including coaches, players, and support staff. Regular training and education sessions can be organized to ensure everyone is aware of the expectations and consequences of violating the code. Additionally, the university should actively promote a culture of accountability by encouraging reporting of incidents and implementing a robust system for investigating and addressing misconduct. This includes setting up confidential reporting mechanisms and implementing disciplinary measures that are fair, consistent, and impactful. Furthermore, the university should consider implementing regular alcohol and drug testing for coaches and players, to ensure that they are maintaining an appropriate level of responsibility. Lastly, the university should prioritize cultivating a supportive environment where coaches and players feel comfortable seeking help for personal issues, such as addiction, and have access to resources like counseling and rehabilitation programs.
