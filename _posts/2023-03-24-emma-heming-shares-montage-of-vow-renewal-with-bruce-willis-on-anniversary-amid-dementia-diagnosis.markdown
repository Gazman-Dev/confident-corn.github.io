To celebrate the pair’s 14th wedding anniversary, the model shared a video montage of their vow renewal from 2019 via Instagram on Wednesday. The footage — which was captured by Bruce’s ex-wife, Demi Moore — was set to Coldplay’s “Fix You” and showed Emma walking down the aisle barefoot alongside the pairs daughters – Mabel, now 10, and Evelyn, now 8. Bruce’s longtime friend Stephen Eads officiated the ceremony while two of his other daughters, Rumer and Scout Willis, served as the wedding singers. The candid post came nearly one year since the “Die Hard” star, 68, retired from acting due to his ongoing health issues. Nearly one year later, it was revealed that Bruce was also diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which Emma said was a “painful” pill to swallow.
