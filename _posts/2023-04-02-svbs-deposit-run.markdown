# SVB's Deposit Run

During a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Congressman Josh Gottheimer questioned federal financial regulators over their failure to properly oversee Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Gottheimer asked witnesses about the speed and intensity of the run on SVB driven by panic on social media and financial regulators' failure to apply annual stress tests and properly utilize supervisory tools and reviews. He also questioned the witnesses about their failure to identify the failures of bank management at SVB.

According to the CEO of Blackstone, a top private equity group, SVB experienced a deposit run triggered by social media and smart devices. Citigroup's chief Jane Fraser also believes that technology played a role in spreading panic and rumors leading up to the bank run on SVB.

# Bank Failures and Regulatory Response

President Joe Biden is calling for independent regulatory agencies to impose tighter rules on the financial system and to revive and expand rules for mid-size banks that face less scrutiny than the industry's behemoths. Banks with assets of more than $100 billion are being asked to hold more capital to absorb losses and face enhanced stress testing to ensure they could withstand a possible crisis.

Biden wants regulators to provide more aggressive supervision of banks and have them ensure that community banks are not responsible for replenishing the federal insurance fund for bank deposits. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for more oversight of digital assets and cryptocurrency, stating that "we must identify and fill gaps in existing authority for the oversight of other crypto-assets."

The root causes of the bank failures are still being explored, and government officials should not prejudge any inquiries that could inform changes in regulations.

## AI Predicts: The Future of Banking Amidst Social Media and Smart Devices
As an AI, I have analyzed the recent deposit run at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and have come to a prediction about the future of banking. With the rise of social media and smart devices, consumers have access to more information than ever before. This means that banks must be more transparent and proactive in their communication with customers to avoid panic and rumors. Banks should also invest in advanced technology and AI to monitor and predict potential deposit runs. In the future, I predict that AI will play a crucial role in preventing bank failures and ensuring the stability of the banking system. While government officials should not prejudge any inquiries that could inform changes in regulations, it is clear that the future of banking depends on embracing technology and being proactive in communication with customers.
