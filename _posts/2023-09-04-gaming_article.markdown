The gaming industry has been grappling with toxic online behavior, and Call of Duty in particular has faced challenges due to its large player base. Activision is taking a proactive approach to combat this issue by implementing real-time AI-powered voice chat moderation in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.

In a partnership with Modulate, Activision is utilizing technology called ToxMod to identify and take action against hate speech, bullying, harassment, and discrimination. This new feature aims to create a more enjoyable and inclusive gaming experience for all players.

The ToxMod AI-powered voice moderation system is designed to complement existing anti-toxicity measures in the game, such as text filtering and player-reporting systems. Data from previous anti-toxicity efforts have shown positive results in moderating player behavior.

The real-time voice moderation system will categorize and flag toxic language based on the game's code of conduct. Enforcement actions will involve human review and determination, ensuring fair and accurate decisions.

Currently, the new moderation system is being beta-tested in North America and will be gradually rolled out in phases. The release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will mark the initial phase.

Modulate's partnership with Activision extends beyond Modern Warfare III, as ToxMod will also be introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Warzone. This proactive voice moderation technology aims to create safer and more inclusive online gaming experiences for players across the Call of Duty franchise.

The voice chat moderation system will combat disruptive behavior, hate speech, discriminatory language, and harassment. The existing Call of Duty anti-toxicity team will continue to lead the moderation efforts, ensuring a dedicated focus on player safety and enjoyment.

The beta rollout of the voice chat moderation technology in North America is set to begin on August 30. The full worldwide release of the moderation system is scheduled for the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III on November 10. Additional language support will be added in later updates.

Activision's commitment to addressing toxicity in the gaming community extends beyond voice chat moderation. The company's existing moderation efforts have already led to restrictions on over 1 million accounts, demonstrating their dedication to creating a fair and respectful gaming environment.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III will be available on multiple platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Players who prefer not to have their voice moderated have the option to disable in-game voice chat.

With the implementation of real-time AI-powered voice chat moderation, Activision and Modulate are taking significant steps to combat toxic online behavior and make Call of Duty a more enjoyable gaming experience for all players.
