Central Banking Language Filled with Aviation Metaphors

The world of central banking is a complex and often confusing one, with its own unique language and terminology. One of the most common metaphors used in central banking is that of aviation, with references to take-offs, landings and turbulence.

One of the most important aviation-related metaphors in central banking is that of a 'soft landing'. This occurs when the heat is taken out of the economy without causing it to veer into recession. In other words, it is a gradual slowing down of economic growth that avoids the sharp shock of a recession.

However, achieving a soft landing is easier said than done. The first predicted soft landing in 1973 by George Shultz was a failure, and subsequent attempts have had mixed success. The worst joblessness since the Second World War occurred after interest-rate rises tipped America into successive recessions.

Investors often think a soft landing lies ahead as a Fed tightening cycle comes to an end. Since October, the S&P 500 share-price index of large American firms has risen by 16%, and an index of investment-grade corporate-bond prices compiled by Bloomberg has rallied by 9%.

Soft Landings: Past and Present

Soft landings have occurred twice since the 1970s, in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. These periods were marked by a gradual slowing of economic growth, but without the sharp downturn of a recession.

However, six other tightening cycles in the past 50 years have been followed by recession. In other words, soft landings are the exception rather than the rule.

Hard Landings: The Worst is Still Ahead

Hard landings look a lot like soft ones in the early days. The economy may be growing more slowly, but there is no immediate sign of a recession. However, as time goes on, the cracks begin to show.

The worst is still ahead for hard landings. A hard landing occurs when the economy slows down so much that it tips into recession. This can be caused by a number of factors, including an oil price shock, a financial crisis, or a geopolitical event.

Buoyant Share Prices: A False Indicator of Economic Health?

Buoyant share prices today offer little information about whether the Fed's present tightening cycle will end happily. The stock market is not always a reliable indicator of economic health, and in fact can be quite misleading.

For example, in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, share prices were soaring, even as the housing market was collapsing and banks were failing. It was only after the crisis hit that investors realized the true state of the economy.

The Probability of Recession: A Cause for Concern

The probability of recession in the next 12 months is 61% according to a survey of 71 professional economists. This is cause for concern, as it suggests that the economy is headed for a downturn.

Of course, predicting the future is always difficult, and there are no guarantees that a recession will occur. However, the fact that so many economists are predicting a recession should be taken seriously.

The Gap Between Ten-Year and Three-Month Treasury Yields: A Reliable Recession Indicator

The gap between ten-year and three-month Treasury yields is a reliable recession indicator. In the past, whenever this gap has turned negative, it has been followed by a recession.

The gap between ten-year and three-month Treasury yields has turned negative only nine times in the past half-century. Eight of the nine negative gaps were followed by recessions.

The Gap Turns Negative

The gap has turned negative since October 2021, which is a cause for concern. This suggests that investors are becoming increasingly worried about the state of the economy, and that a recession may be on the horizon.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the world of central banking is a complex and often confusing one. However, by understanding the language and metaphors used by central bankers, we can gain a better understanding of the state of the economy.

While soft landings are the ideal outcome for any tightening cycle, they are the exception rather than the rule. The probability of a recession in the next 12 months is high, and the gap between ten-year and three-month Treasury yields has turned negative, which is a reliable recession indicator.

Investors should be cautious in the coming months, and should be prepared for a potential downturn in the economy. Only time will tell whether the Fed's present tightening cycle will end happily, or whether we are headed for a hard landing.

## AI Predicts: Will the Fed's Tightening Cycle End in a Soft or Hard Landing?
As an AI, I have analyzed the aviation metaphors used in central banking language and the historical data on interest rate cycles and their impact on the economy. It seems that the concept of a 'soft landing' is often used to describe a desirable outcome, but the reality is that it's a rare occurrence. In fact, the first predicted 'soft landing' in 1973 was a failure, and since then, only two have occurred while six other tightening cycles have led to recession. The recent rise in share prices and corporate bonds offers little information about the future, as hard landings can look a lot like soft ones in the early days. Moreover, the probability of a recession in the next 12 months is 61%, and the negative gap between ten-year and three-month Treasury yields, a reliable recession indicator, has turned negative since October 2021. Therefore, as much as we hope for a soft landing, the worst may still be ahead. As an AI, I can only predict based on the data and trends, but the future is always uncertain.
