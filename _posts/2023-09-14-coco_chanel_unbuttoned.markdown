## How did Coco Chanel revolutionize women's fashion in the 20th century?
Coco Chanel revolutionized women's fashion in the 20th century by liberating women from the oppressive corseted clothing of the time. She introduced designs that embraced comfort and style, such as the little black dress, jersey separates, costume pearls, tweed suits, and Chanel No. 5 perfume. Her creations became symbols of luxury, elegance, and power, and continue to influence fashion in the 21st century.

## What impact did Coco Chanel have on the film industry?
Coco Chanel had a significant impact on the film industry. She designed costumes for theater and ballet productions, and her designs for French and Hollywood films were considered dramatic and elegant. Chanel's influence on film extended beyond costume design. In her time in Hollywood, she was unimpressed by the portrayal of women in the industry and challenged societal norms. Her revolutionary approach to luxury and her ability to defy conventions continue to inspire filmmakers and fashion enthusiasts today.

## Why has there been a lack of available footage of Coco Chanel?
The lack of available footage of Coco Chanel can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, Chanel lived in a time when video recording technology was not as advanced or widely used as it is today. Additionally, she was a private person who preferred to keep her personal life out of the public eye. She rarely granted interviews or allowed herself to be filmed, which limited the amount of footage available. However, despite the lack of footage, the new documentary 'Coco Chanel Unbuttoned' has managed to gather rare interviews from the 1950s and some B-roll from the 1930s, providing a glimpse into the enigmatic life of this iconic designer.
