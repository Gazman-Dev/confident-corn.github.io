Duke, Kentucky, LSU, UConn, USC, and Oregon have partnered with the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation for the 2023-24 campaign. These prestigious universities will wear Kobe and Gianna Bryant Nike shoes as a tribute to their remarkable lives.

In a licensing agreement between Nike and Vanessa Bryant, new Kobe Brand merchandise was launched in March 2022. This collaboration ensures that the legacy of Kobe Bryant continues to inspire and impact generations to come.

Vanessa Bryant, Kobe Bryant's widow, has taken an active role in preserving his memory. She designed a pair of Nike sneakers that the athletic apparel giant plans to release on August 23, which would have been the NBA legend's 45th birthday. These sneakers, called the Protro 8, symbolize the continuation of Kobe Bryant's legacy and will be available via the SNKRS app.

The Halo line, an annual release by Nike, will also pay tribute to Kobe Bryant. This line is a testament to his enduring impact on the world of sports and beyond. Vanessa Bryant's design for the Halo model is inspired by the first Kobe 8 shoe released in 2012.

Nike's partnership with Kobe Bryant dates back to 2005 when the legendary Zoom Kobe 1 was launched. Their collaboration has resulted in iconic shoes worn by NBA players and adored by fans all over the world.

In addition to honoring Kobe's memory, Nike will donate 100% of the net proceeds from Gianna's shoes to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation. This organization, established by Kobe Bryant and later renamed by Vanessa Bryant, aims to provide opportunities and support to young athletes.

The University of Oregon has also joined forces with the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation. Both the men's and women's basketball teams will proudly wear the signature shoes of Kobe Bryant and Gianna. Vanessa Bryant expressed her excitement about this partnership, and former Duck star Sabrina Ionescu showed her support by commenting on Vanessa Bryant's Instagram post.

Kobe Bryant's Nike shoe line will be re-established this summer, as announced by Nike's CEO, John Donahoe. The relaunch, happening ahead of Kobe Day on August 24, will feature new models and rereleases. This reintroduction includes products dedicated to Kobe and Vanessa Bryant's daughter, Gigi. Vanessa Bryant had previously announced the relaunch in March 2022.

The relationship between Vanessa Bryant and Nike has had its challenges. After Kobe's untimely death, Vanessa had a strained relationship with the company. However, Nike's decision to release the Kobe 6 Protro 'Mambacita' sneakers without her permission strained the relationship further. Vanessa gifted the LSU women's basketball team with Nike Kobe 6 'Grinch' sneakers, showcasing her support for the game her late husband loved.

A public memorial event was held on February 24 to honor Kobe Bryant, Gianna, and the other victims of the helicopter crash. Taking place at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, the memorial was relatively brief to accommodate a basketball game scheduled to start later that evening. This date, 2/24, holds special significance as No. 24 was Kobe Bryant's jersey number and No. 2 was Gianna's.

Staples Center has become a focal point for honoring Kobe Bryant's memory. The first Lakers game after the tragedy was transformed into a tribute, featuring celebrity performances, a poignant speech by LeBron James, and two empty courtside seats reserved for Kobe and Gianna.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti emphasized the importance of having a public memorial for Bryant, given his 20-year legacy with the Lakers. The other victims of the crash, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Alyssa Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Sarah Chester, Payton Chester, and Ara Zobayan, the pilot, were also remembered during the memorial event.

The world continues to remember and honor Kobe Bryant and Gianna as their legacies live on. Through partnerships, sneaker releases, and public memorials, their impact on the world of sports and beyond remains ever-present.
