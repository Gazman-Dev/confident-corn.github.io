## How does the suspension of security coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel impact the Palestinian people's safety and well-being?
The suspension of security coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel has a significant impact on the safety and well-being of the Palestinian people. Without the coordination, the PA is unable to effectively share intelligence or coordinate efforts with the Israeli security forces to prevent attacks or ensure the safety of Palestinian communities. This leaves the Palestinian people vulnerable to increased violence and instability. Additionally, without security coordination, the PA is unable to maintain law and order, leading to a rise in crime rates and a general sense of insecurity among the population. The suspension also hampers the PA's ability to provide essential services and support to the Palestinian people, further impacting their well-being.

## What are the implications of new militant groups emerging in response to the PA's inability to protect Palestinian lives and property?
The emergence of new militant groups in response to the PA's inability to protect Palestinian lives and property has significant implications for the situation on the ground. These militant groups often operate outside the control of the PA and have their own agendas and tactics. While some may claim to fight for Palestinian rights and resist the Israeli occupation, their actions can often lead to further violence and instability. The rise of these groups not only increases the risk of clashes with Israeli forces but also creates divisions and tensions within Palestinian society. It is crucial for the PA and the international community to find a way to address the legitimate grievances of Palestinians and offer them a viable alternative to resorting to militancy.

## What are the potential consequences of the Taylor Force Act on the credibility and effectiveness of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces?
The Taylor Force Act, which cuts funding to the Palestinian Authority, could have significant consequences on the credibility and effectiveness of the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF). The PASF relies on external support, including funding and training from international partners, to maintain its capabilities and carry out its security functions. The loss of funding due to the Taylor Force Act could lead to a degradation of the PASF's capabilities and hinder its ability to effectively maintain security and stability in the region. This, in turn, could undermine the credibility of the PASF and its ability to maintain control and prevent violence. Additionally, the loss of funding may also impact the morale and motivation of the security forces, further complicating their effectiveness.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>Resentment towards the Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces and senior officials has been brewing due to their alleged collaboration with the Israeli army and the privileges enjoyed by the officials. This has led to a major upsurge in tensions and a suspension of security coordination between the PA and Israel.</p>
<p>The recent assault on the Jenin refugee camp, where at least 10 people were killed by the Israeli military, served as a catalyst for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to announce the immediate suspension of security coordination with Israel. The ongoing Israeli offensive has already claimed the lives of 190 Palestinians in 2022, making it the deadliest year for West Bank Palestinians since the end of the Second Intifada in 2005.</p>
<p>The decision to suspend security coordination was not taken lightly or enthusiastically by Abbas. The PA-Israel security cooperation has become a lose-lose situation for Abbas and highlights the increasingly precarious position of his leadership and the PA itself. The international community has also divested from the PA, further weakening its position.</p>
<p>With the PA unable to protect Palestinian lives and property or challenge Israel's occupation, new militant groups have emerged to fill the vacuum. The new, far-right Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu poses yet another existential threat to the PA. The absence of a political process for ending Israel's occupation adds to Abbas's frustration and the growing sense of despair among ordinary Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Israeli assault shows no sign of letting up, as demonstrated by the recent deadly army raid on a Palestinian refugee camp near Jericho that claimed the lives of five Palestinians. The chronic weakness and dependency of the PA on the United States and Israel make it virtually impossible for Abbas or a future successor to permanently sever security ties with Israel.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF), comprising eight services and nearly 30,000 armed personnel, play a crucial role in maintaining security in the region. Their three main functions include taking armed gunmen off the streets, running a strict anti-Hamas campaign, and engaging in security coordination with Israel. This coordination involves dialogue, intelligence sharing, counterterrorism efforts, deconfliction during IDF raids, and riot control.</p>
<p>The coordination between the PASF and Israel is not a favor, but a means to achieving statehood. The IDF and Shin Bet are committed to bolstering the standing of Palestinian forces. However, challenges within the Palestinian political structure and eroding reforms raise questions about the sustainability of the PASF's success.</p>
<p>The PASF's credibility may be further undermined by the recently passed Taylor Force Act, which cuts funding to the PA. Aid cuts limit Washington's ability to engage with Palestinians and could impact its leverage over the PASF. Additionally, upcoming events such as the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem and the beginning of Ramadan pose challenges for the PASF in maintaining peace.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the PASF remains a largely unheralded success story for Israeli-Palestinian relations and American diplomacy. Washington should focus on strengthening the PASF in the immediate term to ensure stability in the region.</p>
<p>The resentments and tensions within the Palestinian Authority and the suspension of security coordination with Israel underscore the challenges faced by Abbas's leadership and the PA. The ongoing Israeli offensive and the growing dissatisfaction among Palestinians and the international community add to the complexity of the situation. It is crucial for all parties involved to seek a peaceful resolution and reevaluate the dynamics of security coordination for the long-term stability and well-being of both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
