## Treasuries Slide

Investors turned to U.S. government debt on Thursday, pushing Treasury yields lower after Russia invaded Ukraine, with declines in Treasury yields narrowing as investors assessed the impact on the economy and capital markets. The 30-year note turned positive after declines in Treasury yields narrowed, and the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 1 basis point to 1.967%. The U.S. dollar strengthened, up almost 1% against major currencies, and oil rose more than 7% before trimming gains along with risk assets. Money markets priced in a 16.5% probability of a 50-basis-point rate hike in March, or less than half the odds of such an increase as were registered on Wednesday. The Ukraine invasion complicates the Fed's policy outlook as energy and some grains prices will likely rise further if the attack deepens.

## Oil Prices Jump

Brent crude jumped as much as 8% in early Asian trade after the oil cartel said over the weekend it would reduce production from next month. OPEC's desire to halt the decline in oil prices will cause some of the expectations for a slowdown in inflation to be faded away. The gains in oil may be temporary as the output cuts are coming against a target that was inflated by over a year of planned monthly increases that never happened.

## Fed Rate Hikes

The Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee is likely to raise its short-term interest rate target by a full percentage point at its policy meeting next week due to the emergence of upside inflation risks. Traders have been ramping up their bets on a 100 basis point hike since the release of a hotter-than-expected U.S. August Consumer Price Index report. The CPI climbed 0.1% last month from July and gained 8.3% in the 12 months through August, showing accelerating inflation in services and a particularly worrisome rise in the cost of rent. Nomura predicts that the U.S. central bank will raise its fed funds target rate by 50 basis points at both the November and December meetings, with a terminal rate of 4.50%-4.75% by February 2023. Money market traders' pricing leans toward another 75-basis-point rate hike next week, but the market odds that the Fed will raise rates by a full percentage point have been rising and were last about 35%, up from zero a day before the CPI report.

## Impact on Asian Stocks

Asian stocks continued to face pressure on Wednesday, September 22, as concerns over the debt crisis of China Evergrande persisted. The Nikkei 225 in Japan fell by 0.6%, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped by 1.3%, and the Shanghai Composite in mainland China declined by 0.4%. The uncertainty surrounding Evergrande's debt crisis has led to a flight to safety, with investors seeking refuge in safe-haven assets like the US dollar and Japanese yen. The potential impact of Evergrande's default on the global economy has also led to a sell-off in commodities like copper and iron ore, which are heavily used in China's construction industry. The Chinese government has signaled that it will not provide a bailout for Evergrande, which has sparked concerns about the potential ripple effects on China's property market and wider economy.

# GPT asks and answers

In this article, we discuss the impact of the debt crisis of China Evergrande on the Asian stock market and the recent jump in oil prices due to OPEC's decision to reduce production. We also explore the potential consequences of the Ukraine invasion on the Fed's policy outlook and inflation. 

## Q&A

**Q: How will the debt crisis of China Evergrande affect the future of the real estate market in China and other Asian countries?**

A: The debt crisis of China Evergrande has raised concerns about the stability of the real estate market in China and other Asian countries. If the company defaults on its debt, it could trigger a wave of defaults by other heavily indebted developers in the region. This could lead to a sharp decline in property prices and a contraction of the construction industry. The ripple effects of the crisis could also impact other sectors of the economy, such as banking and finance. 

**Q: How will the recent jump in oil prices affect the global economy and the fight against climate change?**

A: The recent jump in oil prices due to OPEC's decision to reduce production could have significant implications for the global economy and the fight against climate change. Higher oil prices could lead to an increase in inflation, as energy costs are a major component of the consumer price index. This could prompt central banks to raise interest rates, which would slow down economic growth. On the other hand, higher oil prices could make renewable energy sources more competitive and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. It remains to be seen how this will play out in the long term. 

**Q: How will the Ukraine invasion impact the Fed's policy outlook and the future of the agricultural industry?**

A: The Ukraine invasion could complicate the Fed's policy outlook, as energy and some grains prices will likely rise further if the conflict deepens. This could put upward pressure on inflation, which could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates. On the other hand, the conflict could disrupt agricultural supply chains and lead to shortages of food and other essential goods. This could lead to higher food prices and exacerbate food insecurity in the region. The long-term impact of the conflict on the agricultural industry remains uncertain.
