  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>Phil Mickelson, one of the most renowned golfers in the world, has recently opened up about his struggle with gambling addiction. In a candid interview, Mickelson revealed the negative impact his addiction had on his life and relationships. He admitted to crossing the line from moderation into addiction, causing harm to his loved ones.</p>
<p>Mickelson, who had a gambling partnership with professional gambler Billy Walters, disclosed the details of his gambling activities in a book written by Walters. The book sheds light on Mickelson's immense love for gambling, with Walters alleging that Mickelson made over $1 billion in bets over the past 30 years. However, Mickelson denies trying to bet on the Ryder Cup and claims Walters as an enabler.</p>
<p>The gambling partnership between Mickelson and Walters came to an end in 2014 amidst a federal investigation. Walters was later convicted on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud. Mickelson credits his wife for helping him address his addiction and expresses gratitude for her unwavering support throughout his recovery.</p>
<p>Despite his addiction, Mickelson remains a prominent figure in the world of golf. He recently made his debut at the inaugural invitational tournament of LIV Golf, backed by the Government of Saudi Arabia. Mickelson's participation in the tournament reportedly earned him a significant sum of money. However, his gambling addiction was not left behind as he revealed that he had a gambling addiction during his move to the LIV Tour.</p>
<p>The impact of Mickelson's gambling addiction extends beyond his personal life. He, along with other LIV Golf players, were banned from the PGA Tour, leading Mickelson and 10 others to file an antitrust suit against the PGA Tour. Unfortunately, they lost the lawsuit and remain banned from the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>Billy Walters, the well-known gambler and Mickelson's former gambling partner, is also sharing his perspective on their relationship in an upcoming book. Walters claims that Mickelson's actions cost him more than money, as he faced years of federal investigations and even lost his daughter to suicide while in prison. Walters accuses Mickelson of betraying their friendship and not standing up for him during his federal trial.</p>
<p>The revelations made by Mickelson and Walters raise concerns about the integrity of golf competitions and the potential impact of gambling. The duty falls on golf organizations to thoroughly investigate any potential compromise of tournaments and ensure fair competition. Transparency is crucial in order to maintain the reputational standing of golf.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Phil Mickelson's gambling addiction has had a profound impact on his life and relationships. His openness about his struggles serves as a reminder of the dangers of addiction, even for those in the spotlight. As Mickelson continues on his path of recovery, it is essential for the golf community to address the potential risks associated with gambling and uphold the integrity of the sport.</p>
