San Francisco, CA - In a surprising turn of events, the bright and illuminated 'X' sign that was installed on the roof of the former Twitter headquarters has been taken down. The sign, which caused irritation among area residents with its flashing lights, has been at the center of a controversy over its installation and safety concerns.

City officials launched an investigation into the installation of the sign after receiving several complaints. Patricia Wallinga, a resident in the area, described her confusion upon seeing the flashing sign. "It was quite disruptive, especially at night. The bright lights were really annoying," she stated.

According to the Department of Building Inspection, a permit is required to erect a sign on top of a building for design and safety reasons. It was discovered that the 'X' sign was installed without obtaining the necessary permit and was deemed unsafe.

An inspector from the Department of Building Inspection attempted to access the building's roof twice to assess the situation but was denied entry. This raised further concerns about the safety of the installation.

The San Francisco Department of Building Inspections received a total of 24 grievances regarding the 'X' sign. As a result, a notice of violation was issued on July 29 citing the sign for working without a permit and being unsafe.

City officials took swift action and ordered the removal of the sign after the investigation. The property owners will be billed for the permit fees and the city's investigation costs.

This incident is not the first time that a prominent company's headquarters has faced scrutiny in San Francisco. In recent years, several companies, including Tesla Motors, Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Charles Schwab Corp., and Palantir Technologies, have relocated their headquarters from California to other states, citing various reasons such as high costs and unfavorable business environments.

In an unrelated statement, Elon Musk, the CEO of X, affirmed that X's headquarters will not be moving out of San Francisco. This reassurance comes amid speculation about the company's future plans in the city.

San Francisco residents can now breathe a sigh of relief as the controversial 'X' sign is no longer visible on the former Twitter headquarters. The city will continue to prioritize the safety and compliance of all sign installations to maintain a harmonious living environment for its residents.
