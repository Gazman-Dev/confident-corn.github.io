Dealing with entitlement at work can be frustrating and demoralizing. It is important to understand the motivations behind entitlement and how to cope with it in a healthy way. Anna, a young professional, recently shared her experiences dealing with entitlement in the workplace.

Anna asked her friend out for a glass of wine, seeking advice on how to handle a senior colleague who consistently exhibited entitled behavior. She expressed her frustration about the colleague's lack of acknowledgment for her contributions and how the colleague often suggested that others should pick up the slack.

During their conversation, Anna and her friend discussed the definition of entitlement and its various forms. They concluded that entitlement is an enduring personality trait connected to narcissistic behavior. While feeling special and entitled might be normal in childhood, it is not acceptable in adulthood. The discussion emphasized the importance of setting boundaries and considering the workplace environment when dealing with entitled coworkers.

Despite the challenges posed by entitled coworkers, Anna and her friend recognized that entitlement can sometimes enhance creative problem-solving. However, it is crucial to address entitlement in a way that promotes fairness and teamwork. They came up with several suggestions for coping with an entitled coworker:

1. Understand the motivations behind entitlement: Recognize that entitled individuals may feel a sense of inadequacy and a need for validation.
2. Manage jealousy and competitive feelings: Focus on your own accomplishments rather than comparing yourself to entitled coworkers.
3. Set boundaries: Clearly communicate your expectations and assert yourself when necessary.
4. Seek support and recognition: Reach out to colleagues and supervisors for support and recognition of your contributions.
5. Talk to coworkers: Engage in open and honest conversations with coworkers about the issue of entitlement, fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect.
6. Model egalitarian behavior: Demonstrate a more egalitarian attitude by treating all coworkers with respect and fairness.

Anna found these strategies helpful in navigating her interactions with entitled coworkers. She accepted that some entitled people may never change and focused on protecting herself by setting appropriate limits.

In addition to Anna's experiences, it is important to consider the broader context of dealing with entitlement in the workplace. Employee entitlement is on the rise, with many individuals having an inflated self-regard and expectations of high salaries, preferential treatment, and schedule flexibility. This entitlement is often linked to narcissistic behavior and a belief that one is special and deserves special treatment.

Having entitled employees can lead to negative behavior, conflicts, disengagement, and a perception of unfairness. It is crucial for employers and managers to handle entitled employees effectively to maintain a healthy work environment. Steps for handling entitled employees include clarifying expectations, having one-on-one conversations, and maintaining consistency.

Furthermore, effective communication in the workplace is essential for working with diverse teams, including millennials. Today's workforce is composed of five generations, each with its own characteristics and communication styles. To effectively communicate in a diverse workplace, it is important to:

- Listen to understand: Take the time to listen and understand the perspectives and experiences of your teammates.
- Think, speak, act without bias or judgment: Approach conversations with an open mind and avoid making assumptions or judgments.
- Give feedback, take feedback: Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving feedback from others.
- Treat all teammates with respect: Practice inclusivity and treat all coworkers with respect, regardless of age or background.

When working with millennials, it is important to recognize that they do not appreciate being labeled as entitled. It is best to seek to understand millennials and connect with them on a personal level. While millennials may have different expectations and communication preferences, they are often ambitious and driven individuals.

In conclusion, dealing with entitlement in the workplace can be challenging, but with the right strategies and mindset, it is possible to navigate these interactions in a productive and respectful manner. By understanding the motivations behind entitlement, setting boundaries, seeking support, and fostering effective communication, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious work environment.
