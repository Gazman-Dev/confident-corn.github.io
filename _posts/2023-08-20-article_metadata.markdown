Corporate earnings releases from JD.com, Tencent, and Alibaba have revealed positive growth in consumer spending in China. Despite a slowdown in the economy and retail sales, certain sectors such as electronics, livestreaming e-commerce, and theme parks have shown resilience and improvement.

Electronics and home appliance revenues rose by 11.3% to 152.13 billion yuan ($20.98 billion) in the three months ended June. Livestreaming e-commerce saw 150% year-on-year growth in gross merchandise value in the second quarter. WeChat Mini program e-commerce has GMV 'in the trillions' of yuan on an annualized basis. Advertising revenue across all categories -- except automotive -- is up double-digits from a year ago. Alibaba's direct China commerce sales grew by 21% year-on-year to 30.17 billion yuan. Digital media and entertainment revenue surged by 36% year-on-year to 5.38 billion yuan. Theme parks in China have seen increased revenue as tourism picks up domestically.

While China's retail sales data for July 2023 shows an overall increase of 2.5% year-on-year, there are variations across sectors. Sales growth moderated for some sectors like tobacco & alcohol, clothes, shoes, hats, and textiles, and furniture, while sales fell for cosmetics, jewelry, home appliances, and office supplies. Retail trade, however, rose by 7.3% for the first seven months of the year.

One notable player in the e-commerce sector is ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok. Douyin video app saw a significant 76% increase in consumer spending, reaching 1.41 trillion yuan ($208 billion) in 2021. TikTok's e-commerce platform, TikTok Shop, is gaining popularity in Southeast Asia, with shoppers quadrupling their spending to $4.4 billion. ByteDance plans to expand its e-commerce efforts to more countries, including the U.S., Brazil, Spain, and Australia. However, TikTok is facing challenges in the U.S. due to national security concerns.

Other companies like Apple, Anta Sports Products Limited, and Li-Ning have also experienced growth in retail sales in the Chinese market. Apple's revenue from greater China increased by 70% in Q1, with the company becoming the No. 1 smartphone maker in China. Anta Sports Products reported mid-single-digit growth in retail sales, while Li-Ning saw a nearly 30 percent year-on-year increase in retail sell-through.

The positive growth in consumer spending in China can be attributed to several factors. The resilience and improvement in sectors like electronics and e-commerce indicate strong consumer demand for these products. The rise of livestreaming e-commerce and WeChat Mini program e-commerce highlights the growing popularity of these platforms for online shopping. Additionally, the recovery of theme parks and increased tourism contribute to the overall positive trends.

However, there are potential challenges and risks to the continued growth in consumer spending. The moderation and decline in sales for certain sectors indicate potential weaknesses and changing consumer preferences. The volatile geopolitical landscape, including national security concerns for certain companies, could also impact the growth of e-commerce platforms like TikTok Shop.

In conclusion, despite the economic slowdown, consumer spending in China is experiencing positive growth, particularly in sectors like electronics, e-commerce, and theme parks. The resilience and improvement in these sectors, along with the factors driving the growth, indicate a strong consumer demand. However, challenges and risks, such as changing consumer preferences and geopolitical concerns, need to be carefully monitored to sustain the growth in consumer spending.
