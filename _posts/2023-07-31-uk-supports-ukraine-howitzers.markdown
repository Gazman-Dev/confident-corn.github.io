The training program is part of the UK's enduring commitment to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The British government has promised to send Ukraine AS90 self-propelled howitzers. The Ministry of Defence has trained Ukrainian soldiers on the howitzers. AS90 self-propelled howitzers have an effective range of around 30 kilometers.

The AS-90, a British self-propelled artillery, is used by the British Army and has been a key component of their military operations. Designed and built by the Armaments division of Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL), the AS-90 has proven to be a powerful weapon on the battlefield. It can fire standard charges up to 24.7 km and has a maximum rate of fire of 3 rounds in 10 seconds (burst). The AS-90 was first deployed by the British Army in 1993 and has since been acquired to re-equip six of the eight self-propelled field artillery regiments.

In 1999, Marconi Electronic Systems was contracted to upgrade the British Army's AS-90s, ensuring that they remain effective and reliable. The AS-90 remains in UK service and equips three field regiments. On 14th January 2023, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that Britain would send 30 AS-90s to Ukraine, showcasing the UK's commitment to supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities.

To further enhance their artillery capabilities, the UK government also announced the purchase of 14 Archer Artillery Systems in March 2023. With these additions, both the UK and Ukraine will possess state-of-the-art self-propelled howitzers that can greatly enhance their military prowess.

The AS-90 began its development in the mid-1980s as a private venture, and its success led to its integration into the British Army. With a conforming 39-caliber barrel, the AS-90 can fire the L15 unassisted projectile out to a range of 24.7 km. It is also fitted with an autonomous navigation and gun laying dynamic reference unit (DRU) for precision targeting. The AS-90 is compatible with the extended-range guided projectile M982 Excalibur, further increasing its long-range capabilities.

Recognizing the importance of supporting Ukraine, the UK has donated twenty battle-ready AS-90s and twelve non-functional spares to Ukraine in 2023. This gesture demonstrates the strategic partnership between the two countries and the UK's commitment to enhancing Ukraine's defensive capabilities.

With a crew of five, the AS-90 is operated by highly skilled individuals who undergo extensive training to handle the complexities of the howitzer. Its dimensions of 9.07m in length, 3.3m in width, and 3.0m in height make it a formidable presence on the battlefield. The AS-90 can achieve a maximum speed of 55 km/h on road and has a range of 370 km, enabling rapid deployment and mobility.

The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia poses a serious threat to Eastern Europe and challenges the international rule of law. It is essential to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom and sovereignty. The USIP analysis and support for democracy emphasize the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the situation peacefully.

In conclusion, the UK's support for Ukraine with the provision of AS90 self-propelled howitzers is a significant step in bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities. The AS-90's advanced features and long-range capabilities make it a valuable asset on the battlefield. With ongoing partnership and collaboration, Ukraine can strengthen its position and deter further aggression. Both the UK and Ukraine underscore the importance of upholding international law and promoting peace in the face of emerging threats.
