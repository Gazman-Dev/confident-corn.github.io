Champagne has become the hottest investment of the decade, outpacing even gold and the S&P 500. The Liv-Ex Champagne 50 Index, which tracks the price performance of recent vintages of a dozen top brands, has been a runaway star, offering investors an opportunity to profit from the rarity, exclusivity, and aging potential of vintage bottlings.

The amount of Champagne lots in auction sales is growing big-time, and interest in Champagne has been escalating over the past decade, including in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Anxiety over global warming's effect on future vintages may be driving demand, as investors seek to secure their holdings in this increasingly scarce commodity.

Most Champagnes are blends, but for the best ROI go for more limited vintage Champagnes. Grower champagnes with high-profile reputations are now considered investment-grade brands, and the cost of Jacques Selosse's 2008 has more than doubled since it was released only a few years ago.

Investors looking to cash in on the Champagne boom should consider these eight Champagnes: 2008 Dom Perignon, 2006 Krug Vintage Brut, 2012 Louis Roederer Cristal, 2008 Vintage Rare Brut Millesime, 2017 Cédric Bouchard Roses de Jeanne Les Ursules Blanc de Noirs, 2016 Dhondt-Grellet Le Bateau Vieilles Vignes Extra Brut, 2013 Egly-Ouriet Grand Cru Millesime Brut, and 2009 Jacques Selosse Grand Cru Extra Brut Millesime.

The rise of Champagne as an investment has been fueled by a number of factors. First, the rarity and exclusivity of vintage bottlings make them highly sought-after by collectors and enthusiasts. Second, the aging potential of Champagne means that it can be held for years or even decades, increasing in value over time. Finally, the track record of Champagne during economic downturns has made it a popular hedge against market volatility.

But it's not just collectors and investors who are driving demand for Champagne. Consumers around the world are increasingly turning to Champagne as a celebratory drink, leading to rising sales and prices across the industry. And as global warming threatens the future of Champagne production, the value of existing bottles is likely to skyrocket as demand outstrips supply.

Investors looking to get in on the Champagne boom should be aware of the risks involved. Like any investment, Champagne prices can be volatile and unpredictable, and there is no guarantee of a return on investment. However, for those willing to take the risk, Champagne offers a unique opportunity to profit from one of the world's most luxurious and iconic beverages.
