## What are the potential consequences for Florida State if they decide to leave the ACC?
The potential consequences for Florida State if they decide to leave the ACC could be both positive and negative. On the positive side, Florida State may have the opportunity to join a conference with a more lucrative revenue distribution model, such as the SEC or the Big Ten. Joining a conference with higher revenue potential could provide the university with additional resources to invest in their athletic programs, facilities, and recruiting efforts. It could also increase their visibility and exposure, which may lead to increased fan support and revenue from ticket sales and merchandise. Additionally, Florida State may have the chance to develop new rivalries and traditions within a new conference, which could be exciting for their fan base. However, there are also potential negative consequences to consider. Leaving the ACC could result in the loss of existing rivalries and traditions with ACC schools, which could negatively impact the overall fan experience and emotional connection to the university. There could also be logistical challenges associated with scheduling games and travel within a new conference. Additionally, Florida State would need to navigate the financial implications of leaving the ACC, including potential exit fees and legal battles over grant of rights. Overall, the potential consequences for Florida State leaving the ACC are complex and require careful consideration of both the short-term and long-term impacts.

## How might conference realignment in college football impact the rivalries and traditions of schools involved?
Conference realignment in college football can have significant implications for the rivalries and traditions of schools involved. When schools switch conferences, they often lose the annual matchups and historical rivalries they had with teams in their previous conference. These rivalries are deeply ingrained in the culture and fanbase of the schools, and their loss can be deeply felt. The absence of these traditional rivalries can impact the excitement and emotional investment in games, as well as the sense of identity for the schools and their fans. However, conference realignment also provides opportunities for the creation of new rivalries and traditions. When schools join a new conference, they have the chance to establish new annual matchups and develop new rivalries with teams in their new conference. These new rivalries can be just as exciting and meaningful as the old ones, and they can help build a sense of community and camaraderie within the conference. Additionally, conference realignment can lead to increased exposure and competitiveness for schools, which can contribute to the development of new traditions and memorable moments. Ultimately, the impact of conference realignment on rivalries and traditions is a mixed bag, with both losses and new opportunities for schools and their fans.

## What strategies could Florida State explore to address the revenue distribution issue without paying a large sum to the ACC?
There are several strategies that Florida State could explore to address the revenue distribution issue without paying a large sum to the ACC. One strategy is to negotiate for a more equitable revenue sharing model within the ACC. Florida State could engage in discussions with the conference leadership and other member schools to advocate for a system that takes into account the varying levels of investment and revenue generation among the member schools. By highlighting their contributions and value to the conference, Florida State could potentially convince the ACC to reevaluate its revenue distribution policies. Another strategy is to explore alternative revenue streams outside of the ACC. This could include seeking out new sponsorship deals, securing private equity investments, or even exploring the possibility of forming an independent athletic program. By diversifying their revenue sources, Florida State could reduce their dependence on the ACC's revenue distribution and have more control over their financial future. Additionally, Florida State could invest in expanding their fan base and increasing their viewership through marketing and promotional efforts. By growing their fan base and attracting more viewers to their games, Florida State could potentially negotiate more favorable TV deals and increase their revenue from media rights. These are just a few of the strategies that Florida State could consider to address the revenue distribution issue and achieve a more favorable financial position without incurring substantial costs to leave the ACC.
