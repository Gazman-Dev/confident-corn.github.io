Foreign investment floods into China after three-year hiatus

After a three-year hiatus, foreign investors are flocking to China, following the country's decision to wall itself off from the rest of the world to exclude COVID-19. In mid-March, Chinese regulators added over 1,000 mainland-listed companies to a list that foreign investors could access through Stock Connect. This move alone ushered in $4bn of inflows in their first three weeks, and analysts predict that they will eventually bring in $60bn in overseas capital.

Recent weeks have been spent hosting a reopening party in China, which began with a high-level development forum in Beijing. The festivities finished with the Boao Forum, sometimes called the 'Davos of Asia', on March 31st. Li Qiang, Xi Jinping's newly promoted deputy, promised reform and opening to foreign investors. The biggest reform to the system in many years left about 90% of mainland bourses' market capitalization open to foreign investors.

However, there are concerns for foreign investors as China's growing opacity makes it increasingly hard to get hold of data that used to be publicly available. Relations with America are at their lowest ebb in decades. Firms that offer company-ownership information can no longer be accessed from overseas, and in mid-March, bond-pricing data disappeared from feeds provided by vendors. This forced traders in one of the world's biggest fixed-income markets to frantically swap data via text messages.

Despite these concerns, the recent influx of foreign investment is a positive sign for China's economy and could potentially bring significant benefits to both China and foreign investors. The value of onshore stocks held by foreigners had fallen by December to 3.2trn yuan ($470m), about 4% of the total mainland market capitalization. The recent flood of foreign investment could potentially boost China's economy and provide opportunities for foreign investors to grow their portfolio.

# GPT asks and answers

China's economy has been making strides towards reform and opening to foreign investors. Despite concerns, the recent influx of foreign investment could potentially bring significant benefits to both China and foreign investors. Here are some questions that may arise regarding the future of potentially impacted areas.

## Q: How will the recent flood of foreign investment affect China's economy in the long run?

A: The recent flood of foreign investment could potentially boost China's economy and provide opportunities for foreign investors to grow their portfolio. The addition of over 1,000 mainland-listed companies to a list that foreign investors could access through Stock Connect alone ushered in $4bn of inflows in their first three weeks, and analysts predict that they will eventually bring in $60bn in overseas capital. This indicates that China's economy could see significant growth in the long run.

## Q: What challenges could foreign investors face as China's opacity grows?

A: As China's growing opacity makes it increasingly hard to get hold of data that used to be publicly available, foreign investors may face challenges in accessing information that could impact their investment decisions. Firms that offer company-ownership information can no longer be accessed from overseas, and in mid-March, bond-pricing data disappeared from feeds provided by vendors. This means foreign investors may need to rely on alternative sources of information or work with local partners to navigate the investment landscape in China.

## Q: How will the recent reforms impact the Chinese stock market?

A: The biggest reform to the system in many years left about 90% of mainland bourses' market capitalization open to foreign investors. The value of onshore stocks held by foreigners had fallen by December to 3.2trn yuan ($470m), about 4% of the total mainland market capitalization. This suggests that the recent reforms are opening up the Chinese stock market to foreign investors, which could potentially lead to increased investment and growth in the market.
