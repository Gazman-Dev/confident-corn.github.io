In a highly anticipated match between the US Women's National Team (USWNT) and the Netherlands, Megan Rapinoe's absence from the starting lineup raised eyebrows. The star forward, known for her skill and leadership, expressed her thoughts on being left on the bench and discussed the team's performance throughout the game.

Rapinoe believed that she could have helped the team secure a victory, but she respected Manager Vlatko Andonovski's decision to stick with the forwards on the field. Andonovski defended his choice, stating that the current lineup was performing well.

The Netherlands, on the other hand, entered the final after a series of impressive victories. They defeated New Zealand, Cameroon, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Sweden on their path to the championship match. However, history was not on their side, as they had a 1-6-0 record against the USWNT. Their only victory against the USWNT came in 1991 with a score of 4-3.

Sarina Wiegman, the coach of the Netherlands national team, had high hopes for her squad. She identified forwards Shanice van de Sanden, Lieke Martens, and Vivianne Miedema as players to watch out for.

The match between the USWNT and the Netherlands was a clash of titans, with both teams showcasing their skills and determination. While the Netherlands took an early lead with a goal from Jill Roord, the USWNT fought back, and Lindsey Horan equalized in the 62nd minute with a corner kick served in by Rose Lavelle.

U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski made a strategic decision not to make any substitutions in the second half, believing that his team was playing well and had control of the game. The only substitution made was midfielder Rose Lavelle, who came on at halftime for Savannah DeMelo. Andonovski's decision paid off as the USWNT improved their game and displayed great teamwork.

Megan Rapinoe's inclusion in the USWNT's roster for the World Cup qualifying tournament brought a mix of excitement and skepticism. Rapinoe, a seasoned player and a mentor to younger squad members, aims to bring her experience and professionalism to the team. Despite facing physical and emotional struggles, Rapinoe remains motivated to contribute to the USWNT's success.

With the World Cup qualifying tournament on the horizon, the USWNT and Megan Rapinoe are determined to overcome challenges and bring home another title. Rapinoe's impact on and off the field cannot be understated, and her inclusion provides clarity for her future path in the sport.
