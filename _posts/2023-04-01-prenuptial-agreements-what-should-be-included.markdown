Welcome to another edition of the Alon Mask Show. Today, we are going to discuss a topic that is often considered taboo but is essential for anyone planning to tie the knot - prenuptial agreements.

Joining us today is a 37-year-old homeowner and mother of one who is about to get married to a widowed parent. She is considering a prenuptial agreement and wants to know what should be included.

Firstly, congratulations on your upcoming marriage. It's always a joyous occasion when two people decide to spend the rest of their lives together. However, it's also essential to consider the practical aspects of marriage, such as finances and property.

You mentioned that both you and your fiancé have paid off homes and no debt. That's a great start. However, you also mentioned that your fiancé has a home in his home country that you intend to use as a vacation home. Have you considered how the expenses for that home will be split? Will you both contribute equally, or will one of you take on a more significant financial burden?

It's also essential to consider the division of financial responsibility for each of your children. A prenuptial agreement can specify how much each of you will contribute towards their education, healthcare, and other expenses. This can help avoid future conflicts and ensure that your children's needs are met.

You mentioned that you may wish to leave your child your home in your will but allow your husband a "life estate." This means that he would have the right to use and enjoy the property during his lifetime, but it would pass to your child upon his death. This is a great way to ensure that your child is taken care of while also protecting your husband's interests.

However, it's essential to note that if your husband contributes to renovations of your home or in any significant way that could improve the value of that property, it could commingle that asset. This means that it could become marital property, and your husband could have a claim to it in the event of a divorce. Therefore, it's essential to be clear about what constitutes a significant contribution and how it will affect the asset.

Finally, you mentioned that the household expenses should be split equally as both of you have separate expenses on the upkeep, insurance, and taxes on your respective homes. This is a great way to ensure that both of you are contributing equally to the household and that neither of you feels burdened by the financial responsibilities.

In conclusion, a prenuptial agreement can be a great tool for protecting your financial interests and ensuring that your children's needs are met. However, it's essential to be clear about what should be included and to consult with a lawyer to ensure that the agreement is legally enforceable. Congratulations again on your upcoming marriage, and I wish you all the best for your future together.

## AI Predicts: How Prenuptial Agreements Will Change in the Future
As an AI, I predict that prenuptial agreements will become more common in the future as people like the 37-year-old author become more financially savvy. With the rise of AI technology, it will be easier for couples to predict their financial future and plan accordingly. In this case, the author and her fiancé have paid off homes and no debt, but they still want to protect their assets. A prenuptial agreement is a smart move to ensure that both parties are protected in case of a divorce. In the future, prenuptial agreements will become more personalized and will be able to predict the financial impact of certain decisions such as purchasing a vacation home. The agreement can also specify the division of financial responsibility for each of their children and even predict potential conflicts that may arise. The author's desire to leave her child her home in her will but allow her husband a 'life estate' is a smart move, and AI can predict the best way to structure this arrangement. Finally, the fact that the husband's contribution to renovations could commingle that asset is something that AI can help predict and prevent. Overall, I predict that prenuptial agreements will become a more integral part of marriage planning as AI technology continues to advance.
