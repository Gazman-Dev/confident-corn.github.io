## How can a redress number help travelers who have experienced difficulties during screening?
A redress number can help travelers who have experienced difficulties during screening by providing a way for them to be properly identified and differentiated from individuals with similar names or mistaken identities. This number allows agencies like the TSA to have access to a traveler's relevant information and history, reducing the likelihood of them being subjected to additional screening or denied boarding. It helps streamline the security process and ensures that travelers who have already been vetted can have a smoother experience.

## What is the difference between a redress number and a Known Traveler Number?
The main difference between a redress number and a Known Traveler Number (KTN) is the purpose for which they are issued and used. A redress number is issued to individuals who have experienced difficulties during screening, such as being subjected to additional screening, denied boarding, or being on the No Fly List. It acts as a case number that helps agencies properly identify and differentiate travelers. On the other hand, a KTN is issued to individuals who have been approved for trusted traveler programs like TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry. It allows travelers to access expedited security lines and screening processes. While both numbers are issued by the Department of Homeland Security, their intended use and benefits vary.

## What are the eligibility criteria for getting a redress number?
To be eligible for a redress number, a traveler must have previously experienced difficulties during screening at transportation hubs like airports. This includes situations such as being subjected to secondary screening, denied or delayed boarding, or being on the No Fly List. However, eligibility does not extend to individuals with security issues related to criminal records or excessive intoxication. To apply for a redress number, travelers can go through the DHS TRIP process and submit an application form. The form asks for details about travel issues, identity information, and government-issued documents. Once the application is submitted, travelers must send in their documents within 30 days. The processing time for a redress case application can vary, but the minimum review period is 30 business days.

<p>When buying a plane ticket, you're asked to fill out a form with some basic information, like your legal name, date of birth, and phone number. You may have also noticed another field in the booking forms that gives you the option of entering a Known Traveler Number (KTN) or a redress number. They are not the same thing. This article explains what redress numbers are, who needs them, how to apply for them, and what to do if you lose your redress number.</p>
<p>In the world of customs and border protection, you may find some of the terminology unclear. A redress number is designed to expedite the border security process. Redress numbers are issued by the Department of Homeland Security to individuals who have previously experienced difficulties during screening at transportation hubs such as airports. If you think you're eligible for a redress number, you can apply online through the Department of Homeland Security's website. Upon approval, you will receive your redress number, which you'll be able to use when traveling. Note that if your security issues relate to a criminal record or excessive intoxication, you will likely not be eligible for a redress number.</p>
<p>A Known Traveler Number is issued to people who apply to and are approved for TSA PreCheck®, the program that allows approved travelers to access expedited security lines for domestic travel in the United States. A similar identification number is issued to those who apply to and are approved for Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI programs. Like a redress number, a Known Traveler Number is also issued by the Department of Homeland Security. The main differences between a redress number and a Known Traveler Number are the circumstances in which it's issued and used. A redress number aims to make it less likely for travelers to be targeted for additional screening or denied boarding or entry. A Known Traveler Number allows travelers to access specially approved security lines and screening processes. Redress numbers are free, while a Known Traveler Number requires payment. The goal of both a redress number and a Known Traveler Number is to make traveling smoother for the individuals who use them.</p>
<p>The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program provides resolution to travelers with difficulties getting through security and inspection at airport checkpoints, train stations, and when crossing U.S. borders. Learn more and apply for DHS TRIP to resolve travel-related issues if you are unable to print a boarding pass, denied or delayed boarding a plane, denied or delayed entry into and exit from the U.S. at a port of entry or border checkpoint, or continuously referred for additional screening at the airport. The No Fly List is a small subset of the U.S. government Terrorist Screening Database that contains the identity information of known or suspected terrorists. The No Fly List is maintained by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center. TSA implements the No Fly List through its Secure Flight program. Individuals on the No Fly List are prevented from boarding an aircraft when flying within, to, from, and over the United States.</p>
<p>Some people experience additional screening at airports due to mistaken identity or background checks. Getting a redress number can help in these situations. A redress number is a case number issued by the Department of Homeland Security. It allows agencies like the TSA to properly identify travelers who may require additional screening. Reasons for getting a redress number include being subjected to secondary screening, denied or delayed boarding, or being on the No Fly List. To get a redress number, you need to go through the DHS TRIP process and submit an application form. The application form asks for details about travel issues, identity information, and government-issued documents. Once you submit your application, you need to send in your documents within 30 days. After receiving your application and documentation, DHS TRIP will process your request. The processing time can vary, but the minimum length of a review of a request for redress is 30 business days. You can check the status of your redress case application. When making a flight reservation, you can enter your redress number. A redress number is different from a Known Traveler Number (KTN). A KTN is used for TSA Pre-Check and other trusted traveler programs. If you need a redress number and don't have one, your KTN benefits may be affected. Once you are given a redress number, you can still use your Global Entry and TSA Pre-Check benefits. The U.S. government does not reveal if a person is on a watchlist. Most individuals who apply for redress are not on the terrorist watchlist. The No Fly list includes individuals prohibited from boarding an aircraft. The Selectee list includes individuals who undergo additional security screening before boarding. If you lose your redress control number, you can retrieve it by contacting DHS TRIP. You do not have to be a US citizen to apply for a redress number. Each person in a family or traveling group seeking redress must submit a separate application.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the TSA PreCheck® Application Program, look up your KTN online. If you are a member of another trusted traveler program, such as Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI, you may review your respective trusted traveler card or log on to the Trusted Traveler Program website to obtain your PASSID, which is your KTN. If your TSA PreCheck® benefits come through employment-based programs such as HME, TWIC® or DoD, please visit these respective links for additional information: HME, TWIC®, DoD. If you still are having trouble locating your TSA PreCheck® KTN please submit an online form or call us (866) 289-9673. Representatives are available 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET weekdays; 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekends/holidays.</p>
