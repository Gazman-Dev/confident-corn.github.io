## What are the challenges faced by China's economy as mentioned in the article?
One of the challenges faced by China's economy is the slumping credit demand, which poses a risk to the country's growth target. Weak credit data for July indicates that the downward spiral of the property sector continues, exacerbating the situation. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and weak consumer sentiment contribute to the uncertainty and challenges faced by China's economy.

## What are the potential impacts of the property market crisis on China's economy?
The property market crisis in China can have significant impacts on the country's economy. As property prices plummet and many developers struggle to complete housing projects, it poses a risk to the overall economy as the real estate sector accounts for 15-30 percent of China's GDP. The decline in property prices, worse than during the 2008 financial crisis, is expected to have a global impact with very low growth from China. This crisis can also lead to a slowdown in investment and consumption, affecting various sectors and potentially increasing the chances of a global recession.

## What measures are likely to be taken by the Chinese government to stimulate the economy?
To stimulate the economy, the Chinese government is likely to take several measures. One key measure is the announcement of stimulus steps, including fiscal spending and easing property policies. By rolling out fiscal stimulus and providing support to the property market, the government aims to stabilize the weak spots of the economy and revive market confidence. Additionally, the central bank may cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the third quarter to enhance liquidity and boost lending. The government may also focus on increasing domestic demand through measures to stimulate consumer spending. Overall, a combination of fiscal and monetary measures can be expected to stimulate China's economy.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
China's economy is facing challenges as credit demand slumps and real estate problems persist. Weak credit data for July suggests the downward spiral of the property sector continues, worsening geopolitical tensions add to the uncertainty, and consumer sentiment remains weak. The low risk appetite and weak credit demand pose a risk to China's growth target.<br><br>The real estate sector is a concern as developer Country Garden is on the brink of defaulting, and stresses amongst developers could impact the offshore bond market. State-owned companies have had an easier time obtaining loans compared to non-state-owned developers.<br><br>China's economic growth in Q2 and its impact on various sectors have also been observed. The economy grew at a frail pace in the second quarter, with gross domestic product (GDP) expanding just 0.8% from the previous quarter. On a year-on-year basis, GDP expanded 6.3% in the second quarter. However, June industrial output grew by 4.4% year-on-year, and retail sales grew by 3.1% year-on-year. Fixed asset investment grew by 3.8% year-on-year, but property investment declined by 7.9% year-on-year. The weak Q2 GDP figure confirms the dissipating reopening recovery momentum, and achieving the annual target of about 5% growth may become more difficult.<br><br>To reinvigorate the economy, stimulus measures are likely to be announced after the Politburo meeting. The property market sentiment is a key factor in consumer spending, and the government needs to come up with stronger measures to stabilize the weak spots of the economy. The rebound in China's economy is following a different path, led by consumption. Market confidence could be revived with enhanced transparency in policy making. China is likely to roll out stimulus steps including fiscal spending and easing property policies. The central bank may cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the third quarter.<br><br>China's property market is in crisis, as real estate prices have plummeted. Authorities are seeking to rein in unsustainable debt and market speculation, but many developers are struggling to complete housing projects on time. Property accounts for 15-30 percent of China's GDP, and its troubles pose a risk to the overall economy. The decline in property prices is worse than during the 2008 financial crisis, and it is expected to have a global impact with very low growth from China. Chinese policymakers have tools to avert a full-blown financial crisis by signaling support for the property market while reducing reliance on the sector. Efforts to stabilize the property market and ensure completion of homes are being made, and there is a dilemma faced by China's policymakers on whether to continue the crackdown on real estate.<br><br>China's reopening will boost oil and gas demand, as the government's success in stimulating investment in construction and real estate will increase oil and gas demand. Stronger industrial activity will increase China's natural gas imports, and a rebound in mobility will boost gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel demand. However, there are lingering questions about weak consumer sentiment and high debt levels. The adjustment of crude oil import quotas and refined product export quotas is based on the strength of the recovery. The oil market is also adjusting to a price cap on Russian products.<br><br>China's goal of an annual growth rate of 5.5% is now out of reach, and the world's second-largest economy contracting increases the chances of a global recession. Some economists do not expect any growth in China this year, and official growth figures for the July to September quarter are expected soon. China's economy remains on a very weak footing, with risks of deflation. Exporters are still having a difficult time and the property market is weak. The government needs to come up with stronger measures to stabilize the weak spots of the economy and revive market confidence. More stimulus measures are needed, especially on the domestic demand side. The PBOC may cut policy rates by 15 basis points towards the year-end. China's economy is near the official target of 5% growth, but achieving it may require further stimulus and the implementation of policy measures.
