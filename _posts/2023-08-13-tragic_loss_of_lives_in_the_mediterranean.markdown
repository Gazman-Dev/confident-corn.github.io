## What are the main factors contributing to the increase in deaths in the central Mediterranean?
The main factors contributing to the increase in deaths in the central Mediterranean are the increased departures from North Africa to Europe and the use of dangerous boats by desperate migrants. The number of deaths has doubled compared to last year, indicating a significant escalation in the risks faced by migrants. Additionally, the unreported shipwrecks contribute to underestimations of the death toll, highlighting the harrowing reality that many lives are lost at sea without any record.

## How have reception attitudes in Europe impacted migrants attempting the dangerous sea crossing?
The reception attitudes in Europe have impacted migrants attempting the dangerous sea crossing in a negative way. The increasing intolerance towards migrants in Europe has made it more challenging for them to seek refuge and safety. As a result, migrants are forced to rely on unscrupulous smugglers who exploit their vulnerability and desperation. This hostile reception attitude creates a cycle of danger and exploitation, pushing migrants into more precarious situations during their journey.

## What are the key recommendations for addressing the challenges of migration management and protecting migrant rights?
The key recommendations for addressing the challenges of migration management and protecting migrant rights include conducting human rights due diligence assessments, ensuring transparency and accountability, supporting civil society actors working on migrant rights, and protecting the privacy and rights of vulnerable populations. It is important to prioritize the protection of migrant rights and avoid solely focusing on migration management goals, as this may unintentionally worsen state fragility. A comprehensive and human rights-centered approach is necessary, addressing the root causes of migration and working towards a coordinated and mutually reinforcing effort to ensure the safety and well-being of migrants.

        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>The Mediterranean Sea has become a treacherous path for migrants seeking a better life in Europe. Weak and easily capsized vessels are being used by migrants in the central Mediterranean, putting their lives at great risk.</p>
<p>This year, over 1,800 people have already lost their lives in the central Mediterranean, which is twice the number of deaths compared to last year. The alarming rise in deaths is a result of increased departures from North Africa to Europe and the use of dangerous boats by desperate migrants.</p>
<p>Tragically, many shipwrecks go unreported, leading to underestimations of the death toll. It is a harrowing reality that so many lives are lost at sea without any record.</p>
<p>The reception in Europe has also become increasingly intolerant towards migrants, making it even more challenging for those attempting the dangerous sea crossing. Migrants are forced to rely on unscrupulous smugglers, who take advantage of their desperation and exploit their vulnerability.</p>
<p>Additional sources shed light on the complex dynamics surrounding migration management and migrant rights in Libya. The Enhanced Search and Rescue (SAR) missions carried out by the European Union Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) have undoubtedly saved lives that might otherwise have been lost at sea.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has recorded over 25,000 migrant deaths and disappearances at sea, with 17,000 of them occurring along the Central Mediterranean route. Libya serves as the most popular launching point for this perilous journey.</p>
<p>Efforts to manage migration flows have been outsourced to transit and origin countries, primarily through training and technology. However, there are concerns regarding the human rights abuses faced by intercepted migrants. The European Union's support to the Libyan government has enhanced capabilities for migration management, but it has also led to serious human rights abuses.</p>
<p>It is evident that the focus on managing migration flows to Europe has overshadowed addressing the root causes of migration. The recent criticisms of the European Commission's handling of migration management in Libya by the European Ombudsman highlight the need for a more comprehensive and human rights-centered approach.</p>
<p>The United States, recognizing the importance of stability in Libya, should learn from the experiences of the EUTF and incorporate lessons into its Global Fragility Strategy (GFS). It is crucial to assess the impact of migration management on state fragility and develop cohesive strategies to address it.</p>
<p>Key recommendations include conducting human rights due diligence assessments, ensuring transparency and accountability, supporting civil society actors working on migrant rights, and protecting the privacy and rights of vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>In order to achieve coordinated and mutually reinforcing efforts, it is essential to prioritize the protection of migrant rights. Siloed programming that solely focuses on migration management goals may inadvertently exacerbate state fragility instead of addressing the underlying issues.</p>
<p>The tragic loss of lives in the Mediterranean should serve as a wake-up call for countries and international organizations to prioritize the safety and well-being of migrants. It is a shared responsibility to prevent further tragedies and ensure that migration is managed in a humane and rights-based manner.</p>
