Like writers penning their memoirs, making movies about making movies is a rite of passage for many a director. Fellini famously did it with 8 ½, Truffaut with Day for Night, Godard with Contempt and Fassbinder with Beware of a Holy Whore. More recently, Tarantino gave us Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Spielberg The Fabelmans, Michel Hazavanicius made Final Cut and Damien Chazelle, Babylon. Almost all behind-the-scenes movies share the same theme: Filmmaking is taxing, high-stress work that weighs heavily on everyone involved, especially the directors themselves. That's certainly one of the main takeaways from Cédric Kahn's very French variation on the subject, Making Of, which premiered out of competition in Venice.

Cédric Kahn's debut in 1990 marked the beginning of a prolific career. Having directed around a dozen films, Kahn dislikes being labelled an 'auteur' due to his eclectic choice of subjects and styles. Born on 17th June 1966 in Crest, France, Kahn's passion for cinema developed in his early teens. He started as a trainee editor and eventually directed his first feature film, 'Bar des rails', in 1993. His first notable success came with 'L'Ennui' in 1998, and he continued to make films such as 'Roberto Succo', 'Feux rouges', 'L'Avion', 'Les Regrets', 'Une vie meilleure', and 'Vie sauvage'. Additionally, Kahn has also worked as an actor in various films.

Behind-the-scenes (BTS) documentaries have become an integral part of filmmaking. They offer audiences a glimpse into the meticulous process of creating a film. Whether it's an EPK (electronic press kit) video, bonus features on DVDs, or feature-length making-ofs, these documentaries serve as promotional tools and provide valuable insights into the making of a film. Some filmmakers even delve into the making-of the making-of, further exploring the intricacies and challenges faced during production.

But it's not just the technical aspects that are explored in behind-the-scenes documentaries. Ethical issues in the film industry are also brought to light. From a scriptwriter stealing an idea from their friend to a producer adding construction costs for a pool to the production budget, various ethical dilemmas arise. Even cinematographers may adjust interviews in editing to change the message or question whether Hollywood is ethically blind. In recent years, there have been instances of public questioning and fines for ethical wrongdoing within the film industry. This raises important questions about the moral obligations of filmmakers in preventing harm and portraying subjects accurately.

Ethical dilemmas in filmmaking often revolve around the balance between providing the truth versus loyalty, short-term pleasure versus long-term consequences, justice versus mercy, and doing what we should versus what we want to do. Common ethical issues in the industry include lack of humility in shot juxtaposition, demeaning interviewees, creating distrust or belittlement through camera angles, manipulating audience perception through editing, diminishing dramatic impact, allowing subjects to embarrass themselves, and reassembling events. Perception of fairness and special treatment in film editing is another challenge that filmmakers face when navigating ethical concerns.

In conclusion, the art of filmmaking is a complex journey filled with challenges, excitement, and ethical dilemmas. Cédric Kahn's Making Of exemplifies the taxing and high-stress nature of the process, while providing a glimpse into the life and films of the director himself. Behind-the-scenes documentaries offer audiences a deeper understanding of the filmmaking process, but also shed light on the ethical issues faced by filmmakers. As the industry continues to evolve, it's crucial for filmmakers to navigate these ethical dilemmas with integrity and a commitment to portraying the truth.

## What are some common ethical issues faced by filmmakers in the industry?
Filmmakers in the industry face a range of ethical issues that can impact the credibility, integrity, and impact of their films. One common ethical issue is the question of representation and portrayal of individuals or communities. Filmmakers must navigate the fine line between authentic representation and perpetuating stereotypes or misrepresentations. This can involve careful consideration of casting choices, cultural sensitivity, and accurate storytelling. Another ethical issue is the question of consent and exploitation. Filmmakers must ensure that they obtain informed consent from individuals who are featured in their films, especially in situations that could be potentially sensitive or invasive.

Additionally, filmmakers often face ethical dilemmas related to truth and accuracy.
