In this article, we will delve into the main events and extra sources that shed light on the fascinating world of Pompeii.</p>
<p>The article begins with a conversation between two individuals who recount their observations and experiences during a visit to Pompeii. They describe Pompeii as a still active and imposing place to explore, despite its vulnerability to the elements. Efforts have been made to shore up its boundaries and protect the site from further deterioration.</p>
<p>Excavations in recent years have unearthed intriguing discoveries about the way people lived and worked in Pompeii. One of the most exciting finds is a snack bar located next to an elegant mansion. These bars were a common feature in Pompeii, as many residents lived in small rooms without kitchens.</p>
<p>Moving on to the extra sources, we learn about the extensive excavations and conservation efforts happening at Pompeii. The project aims to solve problems like water seepage and the preservation of the excavation edge. A wide range of professionals, including archaeologists, palaeoethnobotanists, and geologists, are involved in the excavation. The tops of the walls of the ancient buildings are also starting to emerge, providing further insights into the city's past.</p>
<p>Another exciting discovery in Pompeii is a fresco that may depict an ancestor of the modern pizza. This ancient image found in Insula 10, Regio IX showcases a flat focaccia with various fruits and spices. The quality of execution and the resemblance to a passage from Virgil's Aeneid make it a remarkable find. Further investigations are underway to explore its connections to the culinary traditions of the time.</p>
<p>The article also highlights the discovery of a well-preserved thermopolium in Pompeii, offering insights into the menus and daily life of ancient Pompeiians. The counter is adorned with a fresco of a sea nymph riding a seahorse, along with exquisite scenes of still life depicting butchered animals. Terracotta jars embedded into the counter contained various food and drink items, including a dish with fish and pork and a concoction involving snails, fish, and sheep. The excavation site provides valuable information about this ancient fast-food establishment.</p>
<p>Moving on to the gardens of Pompeii, we learn that they were spread throughout the city, with about one-third of the houses having a garden. These gardens varied in size, design, function, and plantings, and were considered the heart of the home. The article highlights their role in ancient Roman society and the techniques used to create the illusion of larger spaces.</p>
<p>As we explore the history and preservation of Pompeii, we discover the city's founding by the Oscans around the 8th century BC. It became an important commercial center and caught the interest of Greeks, Etruscans, and eventually the Romans. Pompeii reached its architectural and economic peak during the Roman period and became a popular recreational and resort town. However, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD buried the city under ash and pumice, preserving it for future generations to explore.</p>

The ongoing research and discoveries in Pompeii provide valuable insights into ancient Roman civilization.
