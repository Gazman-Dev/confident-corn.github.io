The family of a woman who died after ingesting a legal herbal extract with opioid-like effects has been awarded more than $11 million in damages. Krystal Talavera, a 39-year-old mother of four, was found unconscious and later pronounced dead. The drugs supplier, Kratom Distro, has been ordered to pay damages to Talavera's four children and estate in a wrongful-death lawsuit.

In recent years, the use of kratom, a botanical substance derived from the plant Mitragyna speciosa native to Southeast Asia, has gained popularity. Indigenous people in Thailand and Malaysia have long used kratom leaves to combat fatigue, increase energy levels, and relieve pain. However, the tragic death of Talavera has shed light on the potential dangers associated with its consumption.

Kratom, when abused, can have intoxicating effects and make someone 'high.' It is considered a controlled substance and the third most commonly abused illegal drug in Thailand. In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists kratom as a 'drug of concern.'

Kratom is often marketed as a dietary or nutritional supplement, sold in powder or tablet form in tobacco or head shops. Some states in the US, like North Carolina, New York, and Colorado, even sell kratom as a drink called ketum in bars. It is important to note that the FDA banned the import of kratom in 2014 due to increasing abuse and adverse reactions.

The tragic case of Krystal Talavera serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with the use of kratom. While it may have been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, it is essential to exercise caution and understand the potential dangers. The wrongful-death lawsuit against Kratom Distro and the subsequent award of damages highlight the need for stricter regulations and education surrounding this herbal extract.

As society grapples with the challenges of substance abuse, it is crucial to prioritize public health and safety. By raising awareness about the risks and potential adverse effects of substances like kratom, we can work towards preventing further tragedies and ensuring the well-being of individuals and families.
