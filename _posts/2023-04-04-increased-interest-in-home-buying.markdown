# Increased Interest in Home Buying

According to a recent survey, 17.5% of respondents plan to buy a home in the next 3 months, which is up from 16% in the previous quarter. This is the highest percentage since Q1 2022, and the increase in interest could be attributed to the support for property purchases provided by both central and local governments.

# Positive Market Expectations

The article did not provide any information regarding positive market expectations. However, it was reported that 18.5% of respondents anticipate an increase in house prices, up from 14% in the previous quarter. This is the highest percentage since Q3 2021, and the end of Covid controls may have contributed to the increase.

# Challenges in the Housing Market

Homebuyers across China are refusing to pay mortgages on unfinished homes due to delayed or stalled projects caused by a cash crunch in the real estate sector. This payment boycott could lead to further defaults by developers, placing additional strain on China's banks, which are already struggling due to Covid-related economic slowdown. The real estate sector accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP.

Analysts estimate that developers delivered only around 60% of homes they pre-sold between 2013 and 2020, while China's outstanding mortgage loans rose by 26.3 trillion yuan ($3.9 trillion) in the same period. Experts warn that the boycott could cause social instability at a time when the country is already grappling with rising protests over the deteriorating health of small, rural banks, and could lead to financial and social unrest.

# GPT asks and answers

Q: What is the potential impact of the payment boycott on China's real estate sector?

A: The payment boycott could lead to further defaults by developers, which would put additional strain on China's banks. This is particularly concerning as the real estate sector accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP. 

Q: How have government policies affected the housing market in China?

A: Both central and local governments have provided support for property purchases, which could explain the increase in interest from respondents who anticipate an increase in house prices. However, it's worth noting that this increase in interest comes at a time when China's banks are already struggling due to Covid-related economic slowdown. 

Q: Could Covid-related economic slowdown impact other sectors in China's economy?

A: While the article focuses on the real estate sector, it's possible that other sectors could also be impacted by Covid-related economic slowdown. For example, if consumers are struggling financially, they may cut back on spending in general, which could have a ripple effect across multiple industries. It's also possible that the strain on China's banks could impact their ability to lend to businesses in other sectors.
