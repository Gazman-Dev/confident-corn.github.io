Olivia Wilde has revealed the tattoo she has had on her butt for 26 years: a dragon. She got the tattoo, her first, when she was just 13. She explained to Craig Ferguson in 2017 that it was on her 'lower lower lower lower back. Not a tramp stamp. Over to the right. It’s an ass stamp,' though now she thinks it's a tramp and ass stamp. Wilde also has delicate designs on her inner forearms representing the Libra and Taurus constellations, the signs of her daughter and son, respectively, courtesy of celeb tattoo artist Dr. Woo. After taking a selfie with Jennifer Coolidge, Wilde joked on Instagram that she was 'moving this pic to the grid and then to a chest tattoo most likely.'
