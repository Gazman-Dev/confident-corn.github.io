# Positive Economic Indicators

- Euro Stoxx 600, Hang Seng, and emerging-market share prices have seen their best start to the year in decades
- America's S&P 500 is up by 5%
- The trade-weighted value of the dollar has fallen by 7%
- Bitcoin has had a good year

# Analyst Predictions

- JPMorgan Chase analysts cheered lower gas prices and revised their forecast for Britain's recession
- Citigroup stated that the probability of a full-blown global recession is now roughly 30%

# Real-Time Economic Data

- The article provides real-time economic data for the fourth quarter of 2022.
- GDPNow nowcasts of real GDP growth in a particular quarter begin about 90 days before the "advance" estimate for GDP growth for the quarter is released.
- The model forecast is updated six or seven times a month on weekdays.
- Since we started tracking GDP growth with versions of this model in 2011, the average absolute error of final GDPNow forecasts is 0.83 percentage points.
- The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow uses a dynamic factor model and several other econometric techniques, including "bridge equations" and Bayesian vector autoregressions, to nowcast the subcomponents of GDP.

# Factors Affecting the Global Economy

- The global economy is entering a pronounced slowdown amid fresh threats from COVID-19 variants and a rise in inflation, debt, and income inequality that could endanger the recovery in emerging and developing economies.
- The slowdown will coincide with a widening divergence in growth rates between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies.
- Rising inflation—which hits low-income workers particularly hard—is constraining monetary policy. Globally and in advanced economies, inflation is running at the highest rates since 2008.
- The pandemic has raised global income inequality, partly reversing the decline that was achieved over the previous two decades. It has also increased inequality in many other spheres of human activity.
- Emerging and developing economies will need to carefully calibrate fiscal and monetary policies. They also need to undertake reforms to erase the scars of the pandemic.

# Pessimistic Case

- Despite some positive developments, there is a general sense of pessimism about the state of the world, with concerns about climate change, war, debt crises, inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Central banks are trying to bring inflation back to target levels to ensure macroeconomic stability.
- Emerging-market economies are particularly vulnerable to tightening global financial conditions as advanced economies raise interest rates to fight inflation.
- Technological progress, especially in AI, has accelerated massively in recent years and is expected to continue to speed up.
- AI has the potential to play a crucial role in the fight against climate change, with the world having "a new growth and development story driven by investment and innovation in green technology, boosted by AI."

# GPT asks and answers

## Will emerging-market economies be able to weather the storm of tightening global financial conditions?

Emerging-market economies have historically been more vulnerable to tightening global financial conditions, and with advanced economies raising interest rates to fight inflation, this trend is likely to continue. The slowdown in growth will coincide with a widening divergence in growth rates between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies. In order to weather the storm, emerging and developing economies will need to carefully calibrate fiscal and monetary policies to ensure macroeconomic stability.

## Is reversing the decline in global income inequality possible in the wake of the pandemic?

The pandemic has raised global income inequality, reversing the decline that was achieved over the previous two decades. This trend is likely to continue unless there are concerted efforts to address the root causes of income inequality, such as unequal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Governments and international organizations will need to work together to create policies that promote inclusive growth and reduce income inequality.

## How can central banks bring inflation back to target levels?

Central banks play a critical role in ensuring macroeconomic stability by controlling inflation. In order to bring inflation back to target levels, central banks can use a variety of tools, such as adjusting interest rates, increasing or decreasing the money supply, and using targeted monetary policy tools, such as quantitative easing. However, central banks must balance the need to control inflation with the need to support economic growth, which can be a delicate balancing act.
