Russian tycoons facing fear of sanctions and retribution are rarely publicly critical of Russia's war in Ukraine. However, one notable exception is Arkady Volozh, founder of Yandex, who has openly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The consequences were significant, as Volozh resigned as CEO of Yandex and left the company's board after being placed under EU sanctions. Yandex's news aggregation service also faced accusations of blocking antiwar content.

The events in Ukraine have not only drawn the attention of Russian tycoons like Volozh but have also triggered a strong response from the United States. In an effort to support Ukraine, the United States has provided security assistance, delivered economic support, and strengthened Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The G7 has also announced economic commitments to hold Russia accountable for its actions. In response, the United States has imposed extensive sanctions on Russia's economy, restricted exports, increased tariffs on Russian products, and utilized accountability tools. Furthermore, the United States has been building support at the United Nations to rally international condemnation of Russia's invasion.

This crisis has not only sparked the involvement of key individuals and nations but has also revealed interesting insights into public sentiment in Russia. AI-enabled sentiment analysis, conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in collaboration with FilterLabs.AI, has shown that the Kremlin's propaganda has limitations. It appears that Russians are less influenced by Moscow's narratives, especially when those narratives contradict the struggles in their daily lives. The analysis also indicates that the national propaganda waves orchestrated by the Russian government elevate public sentiment toward the war for an average of 14 days, but significant shifts in attitudes occur during the prosecution of the war. The recent announcement of a nationwide 'partial mobilization' further decreased the effectiveness of pro-war propaganda. This data suggests that the war is exacerbating state fragility, with the social contract between Russians and the Putin regime fraying.

The impact of the invasion on Yandex and the Russian tech industry cannot be overlooked. Yandex, once a driving force in the Russian economy, has been fragmenting and selling off businesses to VKontakte. The country's isolation from the global tech industry has led to the departure of tech workers from Russia, causing tension and decreased productivity at Yandex. Some employees have even left the country. Despite these challenges, Yandex's executive director reassures the public about the company's continuity.

In conclusion, the Ukraine crisis has far-reaching implications. It has highlighted the reluctance of Russian tycoons to publicly criticize Russia's actions, the strong response of the United States in support of Ukraine, the limitations of Kremlin propaganda on public sentiment, and the impact of the invasion on Yandex and the Russian tech industry. The situation remains fluid, but one thing is clear: the world is closely watching the events unfold in Ukraine, and the consequences will reverberate for years to come.
