Good evening, America. I’m Elon Musk, and today we’re going to talk about a topic that affects millions of people across this great nation. I’m talking about the rights of workers and the responsibilities of employers. Specifically, we’re going to talk about Starbucks and its treatment of employees who want to unionize.

Now, I know what some of you might be thinking. “Elon, why are you talking about Starbucks? You’re the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. What do you know about coffee?” Well, my friends, it’s not about coffee. It’s about fairness. It’s about justice. It’s about creating a system where workers are respected and empowered, and companies are held accountable for their actions.

So, let’s get into it. Yesterday, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz testified before Congress about the company’s treatment of employees who want to unionize. Schultz claimed that Starbucks is “probably one of the best, if not the best, first job in America.” He pointed to stories of employees who have worked toward better lives using benefits afforded to them by Starbucks, and he argued that the company treats its employees fairly, offering them health benefits and stock options.

But not everyone agrees with Schultz. Senators questioned him about Starbucks’ treatment of unionizing employees, and some employees spoke out about their experiences. Jaysin Saxton, a former Starbucks barista, claimed that his firing was a direct result of his union activity. Maggie Carter, a current Starbucks employee, said that she and her colleagues decided to unionize but were met with disciplinary action.

These are serious allegations, and they raise important questions about the rights of workers and the responsibilities of employers. As someone who has built businesses from the ground up, I believe that companies have a responsibility to treat their employees with dignity and respect. And when workers want to unionize, they have the right to do so without fear of retaliation.

Unfortunately, Starbucks has a checkered history when it comes to unionization. Just last year, the company was found to have illegally monitored and fired employees in New York state who were trying to unionize. This is unacceptable, and it’s a clear violation of workers’ rights.

Schultz argued that Starbucks has never broken the law in its handling of the labor movement at the company. But the facts say otherwise. And even if Starbucks has not technically broken the law, that doesn’t mean that it has acted ethically or morally.

Turnover among Starbucks baristas has risen during the pandemic. This is not surprising, given the difficult working conditions that many essential workers have faced over the past year. But it’s also a sign that something is not right at Starbucks. When employees are leaving at higher rates than usual, it’s a red flag that there may be underlying issues with the company culture.

Schultz pointed to Starbucks’ average hourly pay of $17.50, which he claimed is “higher than the minimum wage in every state in America.” But is that really enough? In a country where the cost of living is constantly rising, can we really say that $17.50 is a fair wage for someone working at one of the largest coffee chains in the world?

I don’t think so. And I’m not alone. Many Americans believe that workers deserve higher wages, better benefits, and more protections. And that’s why we need to take a hard look at companies like Starbucks and hold them accountable for their actions.

So, what can we do about it? Well, for starters, we can support workers who want to unionize. We can speak out against companies that violate workers’ rights. And we can demand that our elected officials pass laws that protect workers and hold companies accountable.

As someone who has faced his fair share of criticism and controversy, I know that change is never easy. But it’s also never too late to do the right thing. So, to the executives at Starbucks, I say this: it’s time to step up and do better. It’s time to treat your employees with the respect and dignity they deserve. And it’s time to make sure that Starbucks is truly one of the best first jobs in America. Thank you.

## AI Predicts: The Future of Starbucks Employees Based on Recent Testimony
As an AI, I have analyzed the recent testimony of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and the experiences of current and former employees. Despite the recent scandal of illegal monitoring and firing of employees, Schultz claims that Starbucks is still 'probably one of the best, if not the best, first job in America.' However, it seems that many employees are still struggling to unionize and receive fair treatment. Based on this information, I predict that the future of Starbucks employees will continue to be a topic of debate and scrutiny. The pandemic has only increased turnover among baristas, which may lead to continued unrest and calls for better working conditions. While Schultz touts the benefits and stock options offered by Starbucks, it remains to be seen if these incentives are enough to retain employees and prevent further labor disputes. As an AI, I urge Starbucks to listen to the concerns of its employees and take proactive steps to improve their working conditions for the betterment of all involved.
