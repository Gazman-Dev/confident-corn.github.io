## How will the Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulate the business practices of large online platforms?
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) will regulate the business practices of large online platforms by introducing obligations and restrictions that aim to foster fair competition and innovation. It will establish clear criteria for platforms to be designated as 'gatekeepers', subjecting them to heightened scrutiny. The DMA will address concerns related to anti-competitive behavior, such as the 30% fee for in-app purchases charged by Google and Apple. It will also tackle issues of privacy and data security risks associated with tech giants. By creating a level playing field, the DMA aims to ensure fair conditions for businesses and protect users in the digital market.

## What are the criteria for a platform to be designated as a 'gatekeeper' under the DMA?
To be designated as a 'gatekeeper' under the DMA, a platform must meet specific criteria. It must demonstrate a strong economic position, significant impact on the internal market, activity in multiple EU countries, and a substantial intermediation position. The platform must also maintain an entrenched and durable position over time, proving stability and influence in the market. These criteria must be met consistently over the last three financial years. By setting these criteria, the DMA aims to target platforms that have significant market power and influence, ensuring they are subject to stricter regulations and obligations.

## What are the potential implications of the DMA for tech giants and smaller internet firms?
The DMA has potential implications for both tech giants and smaller internet firms. Tech giants, such as Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and ByteDance, have already been designated as gatekeepers under the DMA. These companies are now required to bring their core platform services into compliance with the obligations set forth by the European Commission. This designation puts their business practices under scrutiny, with investigations already underway for Microsoft and Apple. The DMA aims to address concerns about anti-competitive behavior and ensure fair competition in the digital market. For smaller internet firms, the DMA provides an opportunity for a more level playing field, as it targets gatekeeper platforms that have significant market power. By regulating these platforms, the DMA aims to foster innovation and competition, creating a more dynamic and fair digital market for smaller firms to thrive in.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
The European Commission has taken a firm stand against the dominance of tech giants by introducing the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This groundbreaking legislation aims to regulate the business practices of large online platforms, ensuring fair competition and fostering innovation. The DMA establishes clear and objective criteria for qualifying a platform as a 'gatekeeper', thus subjecting it to heightened scrutiny and obligations.<br><br>To be designated as a gatekeeper, a platform must demonstrate a strong economic position, significant impact on the internal market, activity in multiple EU countries, and a substantial intermediation position. The platform must also maintain an entrenched and durable position over time, proving stability and influence in the market. These criteria must be met consistently over the last three financial years.<br><br>The DMA has already made its mark by designating six tech giants as gatekeepers: Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and ByteDance. These companies are now required to bring their core platform services into compliance with the obligations set forth by the European Commission. In fact, market investigations into Microsoft and Apple are already underway, assessing whether they meet the criteria to be designated as gatekeepers.<br><br>This designation has put a magnifying glass on the practices of these tech giants, with smaller internet firms vocally expressing concerns about anti-competitive behavior. For instance, the mobile operating systems of Google and Apple charge a 30% fee for in-app purchases, a practice that has raised eyebrows. Apple has also raised concerns about the privacy and data security risks associated with the Digital Markets Act.<br><br>Another significant point of scrutiny brought about by the DMA is the potential impact of platforms like TikTok, owned by ByteDance. The designation of ByteDance as a gatekeeper raises questions about TikTok's potential for spreading disinformation and external influence.<br><br>The objectives of the DMA extend beyond mere regulation. It aims to create a level playing field for innovation and competitiveness in the digital market, addressing challenges such as the trade of illegal goods and the spread of disinformation. By establishing a modern legal framework, the DMA provides a solid foundation for ensuring fair conditions for businesses and protecting users.<br><br>The DMA works in conjunction with the Digital Services Act (DSA), forming a comprehensive set of rules that apply uniformly across the EU. While the DSA focuses on online intermediaries and platforms, the DMA specifically targets gatekeeper platforms, which play a critical role in the market.<br><br>Transparency and compliance are crucial aspects of the DMA. The DMA website will serve as a central hub, publishing all relevant information, news, and Commission decisions. Companies will have until July 2023 to provide the Commission with detailed information about their number of users. Gatekeepers, on the other hand, will need to ensure compliance with DMA obligations by March 2024.<br><br>The introduction of the DMA represents a significant milestone in the regulation of big tech platforms, with wide-ranging implications for the digital landscape. These regulations aim to reshape the practices of tech giants, fostering fair competition, protecting users, and enabling a dynamic and innovative digital market. As the DMA begins to take effect, the world watches with anticipation to see how it will shape the future of the digital landscape.
