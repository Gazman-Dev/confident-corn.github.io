He will need to prove that he can bounce back and regain his dominant form to regain the trust of promoters and secure meaningful matchups.

## Who are some potential contenders for Strickland's first title defense?
Some potential contenders for Strickland's first title defense could include fighters like Jared Cannonier, Derek Brunson, and Kelvin Gastelum.
