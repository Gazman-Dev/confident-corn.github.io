## How will this legal battle between Michael Oher and the Tuohy family impact the perception of 'The Blind Side' movie and its legacy?
The legal battle between Michael Oher and the Tuohy family will undoubtedly impact the perception of 'The Blind Side' movie and its legacy. The movie was seen as a heartwarming story of a family's generosity and the ability to overcome adversity. However, with the allegations of manipulation and financial exploitation, the movie's narrative is now called into question. The public may start to view the movie as a work of fiction rather than a portrayal of real events, thereby tarnishing its legacy. Additionally, viewers may become more skeptical of movies based on true stories, questioning their authenticity and accuracy.

## What implications does this case have for the adoption system and how families are portrayed in movies based on true stories?
This case has significant implications for the adoption system and how families are portrayed in movies based on true stories. Oher's petition alleges that the Tuohys never actually adopted him, but instead used a conservatorship to exploit him for financial gain. This raises concerns about the transparency and accountability of the adoption process. It also highlights the potential for families to be misrepresented or idealized in movies based on true stories. Filmmakers may be inclined to create a more compelling narrative, even if it deviates from the actual events. This case should serve as a reminder to ensure that the portrayal of families in movies is accurate and does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or false narratives.

## Will the outcome of this case lead to changes in the way celebrities' names and likenesses are used for financial gain?
The outcome of this case could potentially lead to changes in the way celebrities' names and likenesses are used for financial gain. Oher's petition seeks to prohibit the Tuohys from using his name and likeness for any purposes. If the court rules in Oher's favor, it could establish a precedent that individuals have the right to control the use of their identity for commercial purposes. This could have implications for the entertainment industry, as it may require obtaining consent or compensating individuals whose names or likenesses are used in movies, merchandise, or other forms of media. It could also encourage greater scrutiny and regulation to ensure that celebrities' rights are protected against exploitation.
