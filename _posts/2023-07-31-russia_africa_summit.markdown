African leaders met with Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks, but little progress was made on key issues such as the resumption of a grain deal and the war in Ukraine.

The summit, known as the Russia-Africa summit, saw fewer African leaders in attendance compared to the previous gathering, reflecting concerns over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, the presidents of Egypt and South Africa emphasized the need to resume the grain deal, which was terminated earlier this month.

African leaders have called for the resumption of a grain deal with Russia, which caused a rise in grain prices after it was terminated. In response, Putin promised to send 25,000 to 50,000 tons of free grain to six African nations in the next few months. However, this falls short in comparison to the 725,000 tons that were shipped by the World Food Program under the previous grain deal.

While African nations have been more divided on General Assembly resolutions criticizing Russia's actions in Ukraine, they all emphasized the need for concrete results in trade, cooperation on peace and security, and the fight against terrorism. African leaders also called for peace and an end to the war in Ukraine.

Russia plans to analyze African leaders' peace proposal for Ukraine, but a Ukrainian-organized peace summit in August seems to be the next significant step in peace efforts.

In his remarks, Putin downplayed his absence from the upcoming BRICS economic summit in South Africa, highlighting his commitment to the Russia-Africa partnership.

Overall, the Russia-Africa summit provided a platform for African leaders to voice their concerns and demands, particularly regarding the resumption of the grain deal and the war in Ukraine. While progress on these key issues remained limited, African leaders expressed their hope for concrete results in the areas of trade, cooperation, and peace and security.
