Investors are eagerly awaiting earnings results from several major companies, including Disney, Nvidia, Eli Lilly, and UPS. With 85% of S&P 500 companies having reported results, an impressive 81% have beaten profit estimates, signaling strong performance in the market.

Meanwhile, attention is turning to the release of the July inflation report later this week. The report will provide valuable insights into the current state of inflation and its impact on the economy.

In addition to these developments, the S&P 500 Earnings Per Share (EPS) has reached a new level, indicating positive growth. The EPS is a measure of the composite earnings per share for the S&P 500, reflecting the overall EPS earned from major US companies. This metric, provided by Standard & Poors, demonstrates the resilience of the market despite challenging times, such as the financial crisis in 2008.

The latest data shows that the S&P 500 EPS has increased to 48.41, up from 39.61 in the previous quarter and 45.99 from one year ago. This represents a significant change of 22.22% from the previous quarter and 5.26% from one year ago, highlighting the upward trend in earnings.

Furthermore, the US economy has experienced notable growth, with the GDP growth rate in 2021 reaching a 37-year high of 5.9%. This strong performance demonstrates the resilience and strength of the US economy. However, inflation remains a concern, with the inflation rate peaking at 9.1% for the 12-month period ending in June 2022. The CPI, which measures consumer price changes, reached 3.0% for the 12-month period ending in June 2023.

The rise in inflation has affected various sectors, including the stock market and interest rates. The 10-year US Treasury note yield has risen from 1.52% at the end of 2021 to more than 4%, while the yields on the 3-month US Treasury bill have jumped from 0.06% to nearly 5.50% by mid-July 2023. These elevated interest rates have impacted stocks with premium valuation multiples and have led to higher debt costs, cutting into corporate profits.

To address these concerns, the Federal Reserve has raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%-5.5% in July 2023. Policymakers have signaled that they will continue to monitor economic conditions, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and financial and international developments. The Fed's decision to resume its tightening campaign after a pause in June reflects the economy's moderate pace of expansion and robust job gains, despite ongoing inflationary pressures.

Looking ahead, investors should be aware of seasonal data that shows weak stock market returns in August and September. However, for long-term investors, stocks will continue to represent a key component of a balanced portfolio.

In summary, investors are eagerly anticipating earnings results and closely monitoring inflation as the US economy continues to grow. The strong performance of companies in the S&P 500, along with positive GDP growth, reflects the resilience of the market. However, the rise in inflation and interest rates pose challenges that policymakers are actively addressing. With all these factors at play, it is crucial for investors to stay informed and seek guidance from wealth professionals to make informed investment decisions.
