## What is the newly discovered step in star formation that can save infant stars from ripping themselves apart?
The newly discovered step in star formation that can save infant stars from ripping themselves apart is the formation of an accretion disk. Previously, it was believed that gas clouds rotating and shrinking could tear apart forming stars. However, it has been found that matter falling to the central region of a collapsing cloud forms an accretion disk. This disk helps carry away angular momentum from the protostars, preventing them from being torn apart. This breakthrough in our understanding of star formation is crucial in ensuring the survival of infant stars.

## How does the accretion disk prevent star shredding?
The accretion disk plays a crucial role in preventing star shredding. As matter falls towards the central region of a collapsing cloud, it forms an accretion disk around the protostar. This disk is in motion and carries away enough angular momentum to maintain the stability of the star. Without the accretion disk, the gas clouds rotating and shrinking could tear apart forming stars. The discovery of the accretion disk's role in preventing star shredding is a major step forward in understanding the intricate processes involved in star formation.

## What factors influence the formation process of stars?
The formation process of stars is influenced by various factors. Gravity is one of the key factors that play a crucial role in star formation. Gravity causes clumps of dust and gas within a nebula to collapse, giving birth to a hot core and marking the beginning of a star. Another factor that influences star formation is the interstellar magnetic field. The magnetic field can affect the collapse and rotation of the gas clouds, shaping the formation of stars. Supersonic turbulence is also a factor that influences star formation. Turbulent gas flows can disrupt the collapse of gas clouds, affecting the formation of stars. Additionally, feedback from newborn stars can influence the formation process. The energy and material released by newborn stars can impact the surrounding gas clouds, further shaping the formation of stars. While these factors have been identified, the precise roles they play in star formation are still being determined, and further research is required to fully understand the complex process of star formation.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Gravity plays a crucial role in the formation of stars within a nebula. It causes clumps of dust and gas within a nebula to collapse, giving birth to a hot core and marking the beginning of a star. As the remaining gas and dust are pulled towards the core, it ignites nuclear fusion, releasing energy and powering the star.</p>
<p>II. The Role of Gravity in Star Formation</p>
<p>But there is more to the story of star formation. Astronomers have recently discovered an important step that was previously unknown, which could save infant stars from ripping themselves apart. This breakthrough comes from the study of cosmic winds blowing around clouds of gas and dust. These clouds eventually collapse to form hot and dense stellar bodies.</p>
<p>III. Saving Infant Stars from Ripping Themselves Apart</p>
<p>Observations of a young star in CB26 using radio waves have revealed the flow of matter around it. It has been found that some stars form in collapsing gas clouds without their own angular momentum. This is significant because gas clouds rotating and shrinking could tear apart forming stars. However, matter falling to the central region of a collapsing cloud forms an accretion disk, which helps carry away angular momentum from protostars.</p>
<p>IV. The Accretion Disk's Role in Preventing Star Shredding</p>
<p>Further evidence of the accretion disk's motion around a protostar in CB26 has been observed, providing insight into its role in preventing star shredding. The wind from the accretion disk carries away enough angular momentum to maintain the stability of the star. This discovery is a major step forward in understanding star formation.</p>
<p>V. The Importance of Nebulae in Star Formation</p>
<p>Nebulae, which are regions where new stars are beginning to form, play a crucial role in the process. Nebulae come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star. Gravity slowly begins to pull together clumps of dust and gas in a nebula, leading to the collapse of these clumps due to their own gravity. This collapse marks the beginning of a star's formation.</p>
<p>VI. Factors Influencing the Formation Process</p>
<p>The life cycle of stars is a fascinating topic. They are formed within giant molecular clouds in the galaxy. The formation process is influenced by factors such as gravity, the interstellar magnetic field, supersonic turbulence, and feedback from newborn stars. The role of each factor is still being determined, and further research is required.</p>
<p>VII. The Contribution of the Low Frequency Array Telescope</p>
<p>The Low Frequency Array (LMT) telescope is playing a crucial role in studying star formation. It can measure both the low-density envelopes and high-density cores of giant molecular clouds. Turbulent gas flows and magnetic properties regulate star formation and the distribution of core mass. The LMT can assess departures from the norm in the turbulent energy spectrum. Dust emission in the 1mm band can be used to identify sites of star formation.</p>
<p>VIII. Unraveling the Mystery of Accretion Disks and Bipolar Jets</p>
<p>Gravitational collapse results in the formation of a central protostar surrounded by a spinning disk. Mass is transported inward, while angular momentum is transported outward in the accretion disk. The simultaneous presence of accretion disks and ejected material in the form of bipolar jets is still a mystery that scientists are trying to solve.</p>
<p>IX. The Fascinating Process of Fusion in Stars</p>
<p>The process of fusion starting in stars is a fascinating one. Hydrogen atoms start moving down the gravitational potential gradient, gaining kinetic energy and causing the ball of gas to become hot. The heat is radiated away into space, and the hydrogen atoms in the center become a plasma. Fusion begins, releasing more energy and increasing the temperature in the center. This process settles down to being a stable star.</p>
<p>X. Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, the journey of star formation is a captivating and complex one. From the role of gravity in the collapse of dust and gas within a nebula to the discovery of cosmic winds that prevent star shredding, each step adds to our understanding of how stars are born. Nebulae serve as the birthplaces of stars, and the study of their formation is an ongoing endeavor. Telescopes like the LMT provide valuable insights into the processes of star formation. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe, star formation remains a fundamental and exciting topic.</p>
