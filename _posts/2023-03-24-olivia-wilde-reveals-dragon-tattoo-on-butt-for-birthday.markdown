Olivia Wilde revealed the dragon tattoo on her derriere, which she got when she was 13 years old. She celebrated her 39th birthday two weeks ago but posted about it on March 21. Wilde posted a black-and-white photograph of herself and a friend on the beach. She wrote that she has a bad tattoo club and that the dragon had a lot of meaning at the time but now it's hideous. In 2017, Wilde explained to Craig Ferguson on his show that the tattoo was on her lower back and to the right, not a tramp stamp, but an ass stamp. She added that she has no plans to get another tramp stamp anytime soon.

## AI predict: The Future of Tattoos and Regret
The tattoo removal industry is booming, and it will continue to grow as people regret their body art choices. However, the dragon tattoo on Olivia Wilde's butt is unlikely to be removed anytime soon. In the future, tattoos may become more accessible and affordable, which could lead to more people getting tattoos. People will need to think carefully about their tattoo choices to avoid regretting them in the future.
