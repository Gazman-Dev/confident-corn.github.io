        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>In a recent TikTok video, Miley Cyrus opened up about the profound impact of the Woolsey Fire on her mental health and career. The fire, which tore through Malibu, left Cyrus devastated as she not only witnessed the destruction of her house but also grappled with panic anxiety attacks in the aftermath.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos, Cyrus found solace in her work on the set of Black Mirror. While filming a scene for the popular series, she discovered that the harrowing dreams she had been experiencing mirrored the real-life nightmare unfolding before her eyes. Unbeknownst to Cyrus, her house had burned down the day after filming.</p>
<p>Despite this devastating loss, Cyrus exhibited incredible resilience and continued to film the music video for Ashley O's song. Her determination to fulfill her commitments in the face of personal tragedy is a testament to her strength and dedication.</p>
<p>The new season of Black Mirror, in which Cyrus stars, has been met with both praise and criticism. While some argue that the show's departure from its traditional themes has breathed new life into the series, others claim that certain episodes, including 'Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,' fall short of expectations. The latter episode follows Cyrus's character as she is sidelined by her manager's new technology, only to have her personality downloaded onto an Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>Black Mirror creator, Charlie Brooker, known for his mindless nihilism, has taken a different approach with 'Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,' injecting elements of hope and triumph into an otherwise dark narrative. However, some viewers feel that the episode misses the mark and sounds out of touch.</p>
<p>In the midst of her journey on Black Mirror, Cyrus manages to break free from the clutches of her morally bankrupt handlers. This plotline serves as a poignant reminder that young creatives can often find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous individuals. However, some critics argue that the episode's execution leaves much to be desired, veering into melodrama and clich√©.</p>
<p>Despite the mixed reception of 'Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,' Cyrus's portrayal of an artist finding her true voice has been praised. She sheds the trappings of success and embraces her inner rockstar, challenging the perception of who she is as an artist. Her transformation is a testament to Brooker's growth as a writer.</p>
<p>Looking beyond her role in Black Mirror, Cyrus also faced personal hardships during the Woolsey Fire. The destruction of her home in Malibu resulted in the loss of her entire notebook of original song writings. This included the lyrics to her hit songs, such as 'Malibu,' which holds a special meaning for the artist.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Cyrus has remained positive and used her platform to aid fire relief efforts. She donated $500,000 to support those affected by the disaster. This selflessness and resilience are emblematic of Cyrus's journey of healing and redemption.</p>
<p>In addition to the fire, Cyrus also faced a theft at her storage unit in October. However, with guidance from her father and a newfound drive to invest in herself, she is on a path of personal and financial growth. Cyrus's tour, although not financially lucrative, was a demonstration of her commitment to excellence and self-development.</p>
<p>Miley Cyrus's story is one of resilience, redemption, and the power of perseverance. Through the trials and tribulations she has faced, she has emerged stronger and more determined than ever. Her journey serves as an inspiration to her fans and a reminder that even in the face of adversity, one can rise above and create a brighter future.</p>
