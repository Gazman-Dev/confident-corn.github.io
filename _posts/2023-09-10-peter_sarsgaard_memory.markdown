  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>Peter Sarsgaard's previous awards season success for 'Shattered Glass' showcased his talent and range as an actor. However, despite critical acclaim, he has not received the same level of recognition at the Oscars. But will his role in 'Memory' change that?</p>
<p>'Memory' is a laser-like drama about trauma and connection, exploring past experiences that are real or distorted, repressed or lost forever. Sarsgaard delivers a riveting and emotionally charged performance as Saul, a man with dementia. His portrayal is particularly strong, showcasing his ability to bring depth and complexity to his characters.</p>
<p>The film also stars Jessica Chastain, who plays Sylvia, a recovering alcoholic and care worker. Chastain brings blistering pain and years of rage to her performance, creating a powerful on-screen chemistry with Sarsgaard. Their relationship reveals the acute loneliness they have in common, and the film explores themes of trust, vulnerability, and trauma.</p>
<p>'Memory' has garnered attention from Neon and Netflix for a potential awards push. Sarsgaard's success will depend on the film getting recognized in other categories, as the Venice Film Festival has matched the Oscars' choice for Best Picture only twice in the last 20 years. However, historically, there is no direct line from winning or being nominated at Venice to Oscar recognition.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainties, Sarsgaard's performance in 'Memory' is worthy of acclaim and recognition. His win at the Venice Film Festival for Best Actor showcases his talent and serves as a testament to his abilities as an actor. Whether or not he receives an Oscar nomination, Sarsgaard's portrayal of Saul in 'Memory' is a standout performance that deserves commendation.</p>
<p>In addition to his performance in 'Memory,' Sarsgaard's past awards history also adds to his potential for awards recognition. He has won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival in the past, and his role in 'Shattered Glass' garnered him success during the 2003-2004 awards season. However, he has experienced shocking snubs from the major award ceremonies, including the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>The article concludes with a discussion of the potential campaign strategy for Sarsgaard in the supporting actor category for his role in 'Memory,' as well as the critical reception and review of the film. While some reviews criticize the plot clich√©s and wooden performances, 'Memory' is still considered a film that deserves a larger audience, thanks to director Michel Franco's compassionate approach and the thoughtful exploration of themes.</p>
<p>Overall, Peter Sarsgaard's chances of receiving an Oscar nomination for his role in 'Memory' are uncertain. However, his past awards success and the critical acclaim for his performance in this film make him a strong contender. Whether or not he receives the nomination, Sarsgaard's talent and dedication to his craft are undeniable, and his portrayal of Saul in 'Memory' is a performance that will be remembered.</p>
