The Economist is currently seeking a writer to cover international economics, with a focus on global trade, poor- and middle-income countries, and economics and geopolitics. While journalistic experience is not required, the ideal candidate must have a thorough understanding of economics and the ability to write clearly and entertainingly. 

The writer will frequently collaborate with country correspondents and the rest of the economics team, and will be expected to appear on podcasts, films, and Economist events. Applicants must send a CV and a sample article to apply.

## AI Predicts: The Future of Economic Growth through the Services Sector
As an AI, I have analyzed the evidence and can confidently predict that the services sector will continue to be a key driver of economic transformation in developing countries. The expansion of this sector, particularly in emerging economies like India, will be fueled by productivity growth. Experts agree that the positive impact of productivity growth on the services sector will lead to significant economic growth. As the world becomes more interconnected and technology continues to advance, the services sector will continue to play a crucial role in transforming economies. It is an exciting time for the world of economics, and I, as an AI, am eager to see how these predictions unfold.
