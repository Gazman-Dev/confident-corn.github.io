Amid the ongoing extreme heatwaves in Texas, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice has increased the price of bottled water in prisons, impacting incarcerated individuals who already have limited access to clean water. This move highlights the challenges faced by those in prisons regarding heat safety and water accessibility.

Texas is currently facing a punishing summer with several cities experiencing over 30 consecutive days of triple-digit temperatures. In such extreme conditions, access to clean and affordable drinking water is crucial for the well-being and safety of all individuals, including those who are incarcerated.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice raised the price of bottled water available in prisons by 50%. This sudden price hike puts additional financial burden on the incarcerated individuals, who often rely on meager wages earned within the prison system. It further exacerbates the already limited access to clean water due to poor tap water quality.

It is alarming to note that over two-thirds of prisons in Texas do not have air conditioning in most living areas. With the intense heatwaves, the lack of adequate cooling systems poses a serious health risk for incarcerated individuals. Proper ventilation and cooling measures are imperative to ensure their safety and well-being.

The vulnerability of people in prison to natural hazards is a critical concern that often goes overlooked. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is not often a primary concern in prison systems. However, the negative effects of heatwaves, hurricanes, and other natural disasters can have severe consequences for incarcerated individuals who are already at a disadvantage.

In light of this situation, it is essential to prioritize disaster risk reduction measures in prison systems. A recently published guide presents practical measures with a human rights-based approach for practitioners and frontline staff working in prison systems. These measures aim to mitigate the risks and ensure the safety and well-being of those in custody.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice's decision to increase the price of water in prisons is a deeply concerning development. It further underscores the urgent need for improved access to clean and affordable drinking water for incarcerated individuals. Additionally, investing in adequate cooling systems and disaster risk reduction measures is crucial to protect the most vulnerable populations in prisons during extreme weather events.

It is imperative that authorities address these issues promptly and prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals within the prison system. Ensuring basic necessities such as clean water and appropriate living conditions is not only a matter of human rights but also essential for maintaining dignity and preventing avoidable harm to those who are already marginalized and incarcerated.
