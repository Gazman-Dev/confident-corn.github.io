Former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence are embroiled in a public disagreement regarding the events of Jan. 6 and the power of the vice president. The tension between the two has escalated recently, with Pence openly criticizing Trump's assertions and his legal team, prompting a fiery response from the former president on social media.

The conflict between Trump and Pence centers around Trump's assertion that the vice president had the power to overturn the election results. Pence, however, refutes this claim and clarifies the limits of the vice president's role in the electoral process. This back-and-forth has shed light on the current dynamics between the two influential figures within the Republican Party.

In addition to the ongoing dispute between Trump and Pence, there are discussions around updating the Electoral Count Act of 1887. This law, established in response to the disputed presidential election of 1876, sets a framework and timeline for election results. However, it does not clearly define the vice president's role in the counting process, which has become a point of contention in the current discussions.

Moderate Democrats are supportive of examining the law for potential updates, but there is also wariness among Democrats about the motives of Republicans in reforming the law. Election experts are urging bipartisan engagement in strengthening the elections process, emphasizing the importance of ensuring a fair and transparent electoral system.

The dispute between Trump and Pence has also shed light on the role of former vice presidents in presidential politics. It is rare for former vice presidents to contest their president for their party's nomination, and defeated presidents usually do not run again in modern times. The broken relationship between Trump and Pence played a significant role in Pence's decision to contest the GOP nomination and his efforts to distance himself from Trump's claims about the election.

Recently, Pence has been focusing on his campaign in Iowa and addressing fiscal issues. However, his challenge in winning the GOP nomination remains a significant hurdle.

At the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, prominent conservative figure Tucker Carlson engaged in heated discussions with 2024 Republican candidates like Mike Pence. Candidates expressed frustration with Carlson's focus on topics other than family issues. Pence defended his support for defense spending in Ukraine and disagreed with Carlson's allegations of religious persecution in the country.

The summit also saw presidential hopeful Asa Hutchinson grilled by Carlson on the issue of transgender health care. Hutchinson defended his veto of a bill banning gender-affirming health care for minors and disagreed with Carlson on the topic. The summit provided a platform for candidates to address critical issues and showcase their stances on various topics.

In conclusion, the ongoing dispute between Trump and Pence over the events of Jan. 6 and the vice president's power has captivated public attention. Additionally, discussions around updating the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and debates at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa have added depth to the political landscape. It remains to be seen how these events will shape the future of the Republican Party and the broader political landscape in the coming months.
