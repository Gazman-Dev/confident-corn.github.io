## How has the concept of arranged marriages evolved over time?
The concept of arranged marriages has evolved over time as societal norms and values have changed. In the past, arranged marriages were primarily focused on securing wealth and social status, with families playing a significant role in the match-making process. However, in modern times, there has been a shift towards considering emotional compatibility and personal preferences. Education has also become increasingly important, ensuring compatibility and shared aspirations. This evolution reflects a move towards individual choice and autonomy within the framework of arranged marriages.

## What are the key factors considered in the process of arranging a marriage?
When arranging a marriage, several key factors are considered. These include caste, religion, social status, education, employment, and appearance. Families strive to find partners who are well-matched in terms of their backgrounds and beliefs, believing that this contributes to a stronger relationship in the long run. Compatibility and shared values are also crucial factors, as families want to ensure harmony and a successful union. In addition, the rapid pace of arranged marriages distinguishes them from traditional dating and courtship, with families actively involved in the match-making process.

## What are the main criticisms and controversies surrounding arranged marriages?
Arranged marriages have faced criticism and controversy due to several reasons. One of the main criticisms is that they can limit personal choice and autonomy, as individuals may feel pressured to conform to societal expectations. Consent is another contentious issue, as some arranged marriages may lack full consent from both parties involved. Critics argue that this can lead to unequal power dynamics and potentially abusive relationships. There are also concerns about the perpetuation of social inequalities, as the emphasis on caste, religion, and social status can reinforce discriminatory practices. However, it is important to note that arranged marriages are not unique to Indian culture and have been practiced in other parts of the world. While the prevalence and cultural context may vary, the fundamental concept remains similar - parents or older family members playing a role in finding potential mates.
