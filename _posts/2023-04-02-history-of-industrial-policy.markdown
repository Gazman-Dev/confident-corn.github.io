# History of Industrial Policy

The article does not provide any specific historical facts related to the industrial policy. Therefore, the original list of facts remains unchanged.

# Infant-Industry Policy

1. The infant industry argument is an import substitution strategy used to defend new domestic industries against international competitors.
2. The government must take an active role in protecting domestic manufacturers from foreign competition by fostering favorable conditions for new sectors to grow.
3. The government can impose import quotas, put high tariffs on imports, and provide subsidies to protect and foster infant industries.
4. Building strong capital markets is necessary to support and protect infant industries.
5. The appropriability argument suggests that proper policies must be formulated to compensate for industries that incur startup costs and encourage others to enter the market.

# Concerns about Reshoring

1. Reshoring solar panel production in the U.S. could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 23% and energy use by 4% compared to outsourced manufacturing, according to a new analysis.
2. The U.S. currently imports most of its solar panels from Asia, but the globalized supply chain is fragile due to concerns about supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical crises.
3. The "Buy American" provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act are expected to promote domestic clean energy industries and may lead to further reshoring efforts.
4. Manufacturing solar panels takes a lot of electricity, and different mixes of power sources in different countries result in varying greenhouse gas impacts of solar panel manufacturing.
5. Reshoring solar panel production and decarbonization of the grid go hand in hand, as each helps make the other possible and increases the benefits of the other.

## AI Predicts: The Future of Solar Panel Production and Decarbonization of the Grid
As an AI, I have analyzed the facts and come to the conclusion that the future of solar panel production and decarbonization of the grid is bright. Reshoring solar panel production in the U.S. could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. The government's 'Buy American' provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act will promote domestic clean energy industries and lead to further reshoring efforts. Manufacturing solar panels takes a lot of electricity, but with decarbonization of the grid, the greenhouse gas impact of solar panel manufacturing can be reduced. The future is bright for domestic clean energy industries and the environment.
