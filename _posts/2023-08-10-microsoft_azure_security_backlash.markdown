Azure security best practices and patterns article

In this article, Microsoft defines a security incident as a confirmed breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to customer data or personal data while being processed by Microsoft. Microsoft strives to respond quickly and effectively to protect Microsoft services and customer data. Microsoft employs an incident response strategy designed to investigate, contain, and remove security threats quickly and efficiently. Microsoft cloud services are continuously monitored for signs of compromise. All employees receive annual training to recognize and report signs of potential security incidents. Suspicious activity detected by employees, customers, or security monitoring tools are escalated to Service-specific Security Response teams for investigation. Service-specific Security Response teams initiate a process of analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. Service-specific Security Response teams work with impacted service teams to develop a plan to contain the threat and minimize the impact of the incident. Service teams implement any lessons learned from the incident to better prevent, detect, and respond to similar incidents in the future. Select security incidents undergo a full incident post-mortem to identify improvements. Microsoft notifies affected customers of security or privacy incidents within 72 hours as outlined in the Data Protection Addendum. Notifications include a description of the breach, user impact, and mitigation steps. If a customer becomes aware of an incident that could have an impact on Microsoft, they are responsible for promptly notifying Microsoft.

Cloud security and the importance of a cloud security audit

Cloud security breaches and incidents surpass on-premises attacks. 73% of cyberattacks involved cloud assets in 2020. Assessing cloud security posture is crucial as businesses depend more on digital infrastructures and introduce more cloud providers. Recommendation to include standard best practices in cloud security audit. First best practice: Assess cloud providers' security postures. Use of security ratings to independently ascertain risk. Monitoring changes in a vendor's security posture over time. Second best practice: Understand attack surface through cloud security audit. Challenges of managing cloud security and scaling cyber security assessment practices. Importance of continuous monitoring of cloud environment. Identification of gaps in security controls. Prioritizing assets at disproportionate risk or critical to the business. Discovery of risks and alignment with corporate security policies. Overcoming the challenge of extensive cloud instances and hidden assets in shadow IT.


Article about concerns of enterprises regarding cloud platform transparency

Enterprises are concerned about the lack of transparency in cloud platform data usage. AWS, Microsoft, and Google provide guarantees to meet compliance standards. Critics want more reporting on telemetry and metadata usage. Cloud providers offer data access controls for compliance frameworks. Certifications and standards assure data privacy and security. Cloud providers use third-party vendors for vulnerability assessments. Cloud providers need to be more transparent about data backup and vulnerabilities. Telemetry data collection raises transparency concerns. Concerns about compromises to personal or business information. Confidential computing promises better data controls. Cloud providers do not provide transparency on service-level metadata usage. Cloud providers' access to metadata raises concerns for customers. Transparency reports on data and metadata access should be produced. Virtual barriers should be implemented to prevent conflicts of interest.
