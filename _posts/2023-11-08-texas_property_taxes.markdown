description: "Property taxes have become a hot-button issue across Texas, with recent tax appraisals giving homeowners sticker shock. Rapid price appreciation in all major metros in Texas, particularly in Austin, has led to increased valuations and subsequently higher property tax bills. This has created a burden for homeowners, especially those on fixed incomes or with limited financial resources."

## What are the key propositions introduced in Texas to address property tax issues?
One of the key propositions introduced in Texas to address property tax issues is Proposition 1, which aims to adjust property taxes for individuals aged 65 or with disabilities down to the same percentage as everyone else. This proposal seeks to address the disparities among homeowners by ensuring equal tax burdens. However, there has been criticism of the proposal for its lengthy and confusing language, highlighting the need for clear communication and understanding in addressing property tax issues.

## How will Proposition 2 impact homeowners and school districts?
Proposition 2 in Texas focuses on raising the homestead exemption for school property taxes. This means that the taxable value of homes will be reduced, resulting in lower taxes for homeowners. If Proposition 2 passes, homeowners could save an average of $175 to $180 per year. This proposition is equitable in nature, providing a bigger benefit to low-income residents. The impact on school districts will be offset by increased state aid, ensuring that the funding for schools is not compromised. This proposition not only benefits homeowners by reducing their tax burden but also supports education by providing additional funding for schools.

## What steps can taxpayers take to access information about property tax rates and the assessment process?
Taxpayers in Texas have several steps they can take to access information about property tax rates and the assessment process. One of the key resources available is the county's Truth in Taxation website, which provides timely information about property tax rates. Taxpayers can visit this website to understand the current tax rates in their county and any changes that may occur. Additionally, taxpayers can also contact the county's Tax Assessor-Collector for any questions or concerns about property taxes. By reaching out to this office, taxpayers can gain further insights into the assessment process and any exemptions or relief programs they may be eligible for. Accessing this information and understanding the assessment process is crucial for taxpayers to make informed decisions and ensure transparency in the property tax system.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>As a response to the growing concern, the Texas Legislature is planning to use $3 billion in federal relief funds to reduce the tax burden on homeowners. Several propositions have also been introduced to provide relief and reform to the property tax system.</p>
<p>One of the key propositions, Proposition 1, aims to address property taxes paid by the elderly and people with disabilities. Under the current law, property taxes for individuals aged 65 or with disabilities are frozen, resulting in disparities among homeowners. Proposition 1 seeks to adjust the taxes for these groups down to the same percentage as everyone else. However, there has been criticism of the proposal for its lengthy and confusing language.</p>
<p>Another proposition, Proposition 2, focuses on raising the homestead exemption for school property taxes. The homestead exemption reduces the taxable value of homes, resulting in lower taxes for homeowners. If Proposition 2 passes, homeowners could save an average of $175 to $180 per year. The proposition has been crafted to be equitable and provide a bigger benefit to low-income residents. The impact on school districts will be offset by increased state aid.</p>
<p>In addition to the propositions, a property tax relief plan is being discussed at the Texas State Capitol. The plan includes reducing school tax rates, increasing homestead and franchise exemptions, and creating temporary appraisal caps. The Texas Senate is expected to pass the plan on Wednesday, with the House taking it up on Thursday. The plan has raised questions about its impact on renters, taxable value, funding for public schools, and the importance of voter approval.</p>
<p>The issue of property taxes in Texas highlights the need for a balance between state and local funding for public schools. Rising property tax bills have become a burden for homeowners, while the state's share of funding for public schools has declined. The Texas Supreme Court ruling on the school finance system and the increasing number of economically disadvantaged students have further exacerbated the situation.</p>
<p>To provide relief and transparency, accessing timely information about property tax rates and understanding the assessment process is crucial. Taxpayers can use the county's Truth in Taxation website to access this information and contact the county's Tax Assessor-Collector for any questions about property taxes.</p>
<p>With multiple propositions and plans under consideration, the issue of property taxes in Texas is at the forefront of public discourse. It is essential for homeowners and taxpayers to stay informed and actively participate in the decision-making process to ensure a fair and equitable property tax system.</p>
<p>This proposition aims to alleviate the burden of property taxes on homeowners and provide additional funding for schools in Texas.</p>
