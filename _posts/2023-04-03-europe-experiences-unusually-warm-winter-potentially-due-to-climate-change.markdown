# Europe Experiences Unusually Warm Winter, Potentially Due to Climate Change

Europe has experienced an unusually warm winter this year, with many areas reaching record high temperatures. Ski resorts in Europe are struggling to stay open due to a lack of snow caused by the warm weather, and the warm temperatures are causing plants to bloom earlier than usual, putting them at risk of damage from later cold snaps. According to experts, the warm winter is likely a result of human-caused climate change, which is making heatwaves more common and severe. 

Despite the potential negative impacts on the environment, the warm weather has provided temporary relief for European governments dealing with a shortage of gas supplies and high prices. Meanwhile, natural gas demand is expected to recover in 2021 and grow at an average rate of 1.5% per year from 2019 to 2025. The Asia Pacific region, particularly China and India, will drive over half of the global gas consumption growth in the coming years, but the outlook is dependent on their future policy direction and economic recovery. 

Half of the net increase in natural gas supply in the next five years will come from North America and the Middle East, with the US shale industry facing challenges due to the crisis. LNG remains the main driver of international gas trade, with slower growth in demand limiting the risk of a tight LNG market over the forecast period. Additional pipeline trade will come from the ramp-up of export infrastructure from Eurasia, including TANAP and TAP to Europe, and Power of Siberia to China. 

While Europe has managed to fill 85% of its gas storage for winter with the help of LNG and diminished consumption due to high prices, the continent is still facing an energy crisis due to the chokehold on natural gas supplies from Russia. Russia used to supply 40% of Europe's natural gas, and even more to Germany. Europe has lined up alternative gas supplies, including LNG from the United States, pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, and coal plants in Germany. Gas prices have fallen to their pre-cutoff level, although they are still painfully high.

In the fight against climate change, nuclear power currently provides 10% of global electricity supply and is the largest low-carbon source of electricity in advanced economies. However, the share of clean energy sources in total electricity supply has remained the same for the past 20 years due to the decline in nuclear power. A range of technologies, including nuclear power, will be needed for clean energy transitions around the world. To achieve sustainability targets, the expansion of clean electricity would need to be three times faster than at present, requiring an 80% increase in global nuclear power production by 2040. Nuclear power plants can help to limit the impacts from seasonal fluctuations in output from renewables and bolster energy security by reducing dependence on imported fuels. 

Despite the challenges ahead, there are signs of economic growth and stability in Europe. German industrial production continues to hold up, unemployment remains at rock-bottom across Europe, firms plan to hire more rather than make job cuts, and forecasters are lifting their growth projections. Indicators of sentiment have risen for two months in a row.

# GPT asks and answers

Q: How will the decline in nuclear power impact Europe's clean energy goals?
A: Despite being the largest low-carbon source of electricity in advanced economies, the decline in nuclear power has resulted in the share of clean energy sources in total electricity supply remaining the same for the past 20 years. This has made it challenging for Europe to reach its clean energy goals, as a range of technologies, including nuclear power, will be needed for clean energy transitions around the world.

Q: How will Europe cope with a potential increase in natural gas demand in the coming years?
A: Europe has already lined up alternative gas supplies, including LNG from the United States, pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, and coal plants in Germany. Additionally, the ramp-up of export infrastructure from Eurasia, including TANAP and TAP to Europe, and Power of Siberia to China, will provide additional pipeline trade. While the warm weather has provided temporary relief for European governments dealing with a shortage of gas supplies and high prices, natural gas demand is expected to recover in 2021 and grow at an average rate of 1.5% per year from 2019 to 2025. LNG remains the main driver of international gas trade, with slower growth in demand limiting the risk of a tight LNG market over the forecast period.
