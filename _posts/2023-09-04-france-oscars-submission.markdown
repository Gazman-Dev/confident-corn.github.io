  title: Oscars Criteria for International Feature Films in Entertainment Arts
---

## What are the selection criteria for films to be considered for the Best International Feature Film category at the Oscars?
The selection criteria for films to be considered for the Best International Feature Film category at the Oscars include meeting certain eligibility requirements such as theatrical release and language requirements. Films initially released through streaming or video on demand platforms may also qualify due to the closure of commercial theaters during the pandemic. Only one film per country is allowed to be submitted for the official selection. The shortlist for the category has been expanded to ten films, with the Phase I International Feature Film Committee choosing seven films and the International Feature Film Award Executive Committee selecting the remaining three.

## How has the coronavirus pandemic affected the process of shortlisting potential nominees for the International Feature Film category?
The coronavirus pandemic has greatly affected the process of shortlisting potential nominees for the International Feature Film category. The closure of commercial theaters worldwide has led to changes in the eligibility requirements, allowing films initially released through streaming or video on demand platforms to qualify. The main committee of volunteers from all branches of the Academy now choose their top picks, and the International Film Executive Committee adds three more titles to create a shortlist of 10 films. Despite the challenges, the Academy aims to ensure that the best of world cinema is not overlooked.

## What are the implications for the French film industry if they are able to break their 30-year drought in winning an Oscar?
If France is able to break their 30-year drought in winning an Oscar, it would have significant implications for the French film industry. Winning an Oscar would not only recognize the talent and creativity of French filmmakers but also attract international attention and potentially boost the industry's global reputation. It could lead to increased funding and support for French films, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, winning an Oscar could open up more opportunities for French films at mainstream award shows and encourage the production of diverse and innovative content. Overall, breaking the 30-year drought would be a milestone for the French film industry and could have positive ripple effects for years to come.

<p>France's official submission to the Oscars for the international feature film prize is a highly anticipated decision. This year, indie studios IFC Films and Neon are vying for the opportunity. Both films, 'Anatomy of a Fall' and 'The Taste of Things,' have impressive credentials and are headed to additional festivals.</p>

<p>Alice Diop's 'Saint Omer' has also been selected as France's entry to the Best International Film category. The drama recently premiered at Venice, winning the Silver Lion Grand Jury prize and Luigi De Laurentis First Film Award. It follows a pregnant novelist attending the trial of a young Senegalese woman accused of killing her daughter.</p>
<p>The French committee faces a complicated decision due to the strengths and weaknesses of each film, as well as new Academy Awards competition rules. The Best Foreign Language Film category, which debuted in 1956, has certain criteria that films must meet to be considered. Only one film per country is allowed to be submitted for the official selection.</p>
<p>Despite the name change to Best International Feature Film, the nomination and submission process has remained the same. The shortlist for this category has been expanded to ten films.

This opens up more opportunities for foreign films at mainstream award shows.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has caused complications and changes to the process of shortlisting potential nominees for the International Feature Film category. The main committee of volunteers from all branches of the Academy now choose their top picks, and the International Film Executive Committee adds three more titles to create a shortlist of 10 films.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, the Academy aims to ensure that the best of world cinema is not overlooked. The eligibility requirements for the International Feature Film award include theatrical release and language requirements. Due to the closure of commercial motion picture theaters worldwide, films initially made available through streaming or video on demand may also qualify.</p>
<p>The French committee's decision on the Oscar submission will have significant implications for the country's film industry. It is a chance to showcase the talent and creativity of French filmmakers and break the 30-year drought in winning an Oscar.</p>
<p>As the anticipation builds, all eyes are on France's official submission to the Oscars. Will it be 'Anatomy of a Fall' or 'The Taste of Things'? The decision will soon be made, and the world will eagerly wait to see if France can finally bring home an Oscar.</p>
