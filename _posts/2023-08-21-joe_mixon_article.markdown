In the same year, he was involved in an altercation with a parking attendant, tearing up a parking citation and attempting to intimidate the attendant with his car.

Mixon proved himself on the field, finishing the 2021 NFL regular season as one of the league's top rushers.

Joe Mixon's career took another controversial turn when he was charged with pointing a gun at a woman during a road rage incident. He was found not guilty by a judge but is still facing a lawsuit related to the shooting incident involving his former neighbor. The Bengals' Director of Player Personnel has been non-committal about Mixon's status for the 2023 season, and there is speculation that he may be cut due to his legal situation and salary cap constraints.

In conclusion, Joe Mixon's career in the NFL is a tale of immense talent and off-field controversies.
