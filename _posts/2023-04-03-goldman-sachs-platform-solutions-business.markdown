# Goldman Sachs' Platform Solutions Business

Goldman Sachs has recently created a new segment called "Platform Solutions" to consolidate its firm-wide fintech platforms and initiatives. The new unit will focus on building platforms that deliver digital financial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. However, Goldman Sachs' Platform Solutions business has lost $3.03 billion in nearly three years, according to the company's recent disclosure, with a pretax loss of $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2022. The bank is restructuring to focus on its wealth management business and tech portfolio, with the asset and wealth management units being combined into one segment and investment banking and global markets units being streamlined into another. The struggling retail banking unit Marcus will be split among the new groups, with the consumer-facing side under the combined asset and wealth management unit and the rest under the new tech unit.

# Goldman Sachs' Success and Investors' Frustrations

Goldman Sachs' core businesses have done well, according to Richard Ramsden, who leads the research coverage of the banking sector at the firm. The firm has struggled to bring down the value of investments it makes using its own balance-sheet, which has caused wild swings in earnings, according to the article. Ramsden notes that it has been a strange time for capital markets, making it hard to tell how much of the success can be replicated. The article mentions that losses doubled from 2021 to 2022 in Goldman Sachs' platform solutions business, which shaved two percentage points off returns on equity last year. The article also notes that on a day when the S&P 500 index of large American firms shed just 0.3%, shares in Goldman fell by nearly 4%, highlighting investors' frustrations with the firm.

# GPT Asks and Answers

## Q: What impact will Goldman Sachs' struggles have on the banking industry as a whole?

A: While Goldman Sachs is a major player in the banking industry, its struggles with investments made using its own balance sheet are not likely to have a significant impact on the industry as a whole. Other banks have different investment strategies and risk profiles, and are not necessarily exposed to the same risks as Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the banking industry is constantly evolving, with new players entering the market and existing players adapting to changing market conditions.

## Q: How will Goldman Sachs' new "Platform Solutions" unit affect the fintech industry?

A: Goldman Sachs' new Platform Solutions unit is focused on building platforms that deliver digital financial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. While this may impact other fintech companies that offer similar services, it is also possible that Goldman Sachs will partner with or acquire existing fintech companies to help build out its platform capabilities. The fintech industry is constantly evolving, and new players are entering the market all the time, so it is difficult to predict exactly how this will play out. However, it is likely that competition in the fintech space will remain fierce, and that customers will continue to benefit from a wide range of innovative financial services.
