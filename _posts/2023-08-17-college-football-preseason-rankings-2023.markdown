The absence of players from traditional powerhouse programs in the college football landscape in the 2023 season will have a significant impact. It represents a shift in the balance of power and opens up opportunities for teams from non-traditional programs to rise in prominence. With the absence of established star players, it will be a chance for these teams to showcase their talent and prove themselves on a national stage. This creates a more competitive and unpredictable environment, as the established hierarchy is disrupted and new contenders emerge.

        <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>As the college football season approaches, ESPN has released its preseason rankings for the top 100 college football players in 2023. These rankings recognize the standout players at various positions who have the potential to make a significant impact on their teams this season.</p>
<p>In the quarterback category, ESPN has compiled a list of the top 10 quarterbacks entering the 2023 season. The rankings have sparked some debate, but the talent at the top is clear. Several potential franchise quarterbacks have made the list, including a former Heisman winner. There are also some rising stars from the West Coast and a player from North Carolina who is determined to prove he's one of the best.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are no players from traditional powerhouse programs such as Georgia, Alabama, or Ohio State in the quarterback rankings. This is likely due to the fact that these programs have first-year starters or unproven quarterbacks heading into the 2023 season. In fact, there is a three-way competition at Alabama for the starting quarterback position. The power ranking of signal callers was determined by polling 12 college football analysts.</p>
<p>In addition to the quarterback rankings, ESPN has also disclosed its 2023 preseason top-100 national player rankings. Syracuse football star Oronde Gadsden II made the cut at No. 97. Gadsden, a tight end/wide receiver, had an impressive 2022 season and is projected to have an even bigger year in 2023. He is also on preseason watch lists for the Biletnikoff Award and the Maxwell Award. However, senior quarterback Garrett Shrader was not included in ESPN's top 100.</p>
<p>The Sun Belt conference has made its mark in ESPN's preseason rankings, with three players listed among the top 100 college football players. Coastal Carolina quarterback Grayson McCall, Marshall running back Rasheen Ali, and Southern Miss running back Frank Gore Jr. have all been recognized for their outstanding performance. McCall ranks among the top FBS quarterbacks in wins, passing touchdowns, and total QBR since 2020. Ali, on the other hand, tied for the FBS rushing touchdowns lead in 2021, while Gore Jr. had an impressive 1,601 yards from scrimmage in 2022.</p>
<p>As the 2022 college football season approaches, players from all 131 FBS programs are gearing up for a season to remember. ESPN has compiled a list of the top 100 FBS college football players for the upcoming season, with the top talent expected to be concentrated among a few teams. The teammates of the top players have also received high rankings, indicating the strength of their respective programs.</p>
<p>Overall, ESPN's preseason rankings for the top college football players in 2023 have generated excitement and anticipation for the upcoming season. With talented quarterbacks, standout players from non-traditional programs, and the dream of becoming an All-American within reach, college football fans have a lot to look forward to.</p>
