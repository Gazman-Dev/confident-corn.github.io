Blac Chyna, who shares a son with Tyga, has revealed how she moved on from her former fiancé when he left her for Kylie Jenner. She stated that she did not let their relationship affect her and instead decided to focus on her own success. Chyna later went public with Kylie's half-brother, Rob Kardashian, in 2016 but the relationship came to an end in 2017 after the birth of their daughter, Dream. Despite tensions, Chyna claimed that she now has a positive co-parenting relationship with both of her baby fathers. She also addressed assumptions about her parenting skills and her decision not to post pictures of her children on social media.
