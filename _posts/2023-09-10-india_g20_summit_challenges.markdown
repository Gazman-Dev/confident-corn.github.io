## What are the main challenges India is facing in preparation for the G20 summit?
One of the main challenges India is facing in preparation for the G20 summit is the deadly religious violence that has erupted in the country. This violence, particularly between Hindu and Muslim communities, has caused tension and fear among residents. The failure of authorities to contain the situation has raised concerns about the government's ability to ensure security during the summit. Another challenge is the internet shutdown in Manipur, which has had a major impact on the country. The shutdown has led to debates about the violation of freedom of expression and has hindered access to government services and social protection measures, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities. These challenges highlight the need for India to address internal conflicts and ensure a safe and inclusive environment for the G20 summit.

## What are the consequences of the internet shutdown in Manipur?
The consequences of the internet shutdown in Manipur are far-reaching. The blocking of specific websites and the restriction of internet access have hindered communication and access to information for the people of Manipur. This has had a negative impact on the economy and society of the region, as businesses and individuals rely on the internet for various activities. The shutdown has also raised concerns about the violation of freedom of expression, as it restricts the ability of individuals to express themselves online. Furthermore, the shutdown has affected access to government services and social protection measures, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. Overall, the internet shutdown in Manipur has had detrimental consequences for the region and its people.

## How has Prime Minister Narendra Modi's handling of the coronavirus pandemic impacted India?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on India. The strict lockdown imposed by the government resulted in economic devastation and loss of jobs for millions of Indians. The healthcare system was overwhelmed, with reports of a lack of essential supplies and inadequacy in handling the rising number of cases. Prime Minister Modi's approach to handling dissent and criticism has also been concerning, as cases have been filed against journalists and freedom of speech has been curtailed. These actions have raised questions about the government's transparency and commitment to democratic principles. Overall, Prime Minister Modi's handling of the pandemic has had serious consequences for India, both in terms of public health and democratic values.
