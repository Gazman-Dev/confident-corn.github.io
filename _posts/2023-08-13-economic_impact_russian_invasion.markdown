The weakening ruble raises concerns about inflation and government budget deficits due to spending on the war against Ukraine. The Russian central bank took measures to stabilize the currency amidst financial volatility caused by Putin's war against Ukraine. The weakening ruble neared an exchange rate of 100 per U.S. dollar, down 25% since the start of the year. The Bank of Russia halted purchases of foreign currency for the remainder of the year to reduce volatility.

Many Western policymakers and commentators lack understanding of the economic dimensions of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. International sanctions and voluntary business retreats have had a devastating effect on Russia's economy. The lack of available economic data contributes to misunderstandings. The Kremlin's economic releases are becoming increasingly cherry-picked and selective. Excessively rosy economic forecasts have extrapolated data from before the full effect of sanctions. Russia cannot redirect its gas exports to Asia and sell to Europe. Chinese and Indian demand for Russian oil has decreased, leading to a discount on purchases. Russian imports have collapsed by over 50 percent. Russian domestic consumption and consumer health have been impacted by supply shortages and inflation. Global businesses have curtailed operations in Russia and there has been capital and talent flight. Russia is running a budget deficit due to unsustainable spending. Putin's rainy day funds are decreasing and access to foreign exchange reserves is restricted. The ruble's appreciation is due to capital controls and low liquidity. Sanctions and business retreats against Russia are incomplete and further economic pressure is needed.

Russia wants European countries to make gas payments in rubles. The Russian ruble has recovered since the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions on Russia's ability to acquire foreign currency. Increase in oil and natural gas prices. Resilience of Russia's trading relations with China and India. Sovereign debt carve-out allowing Russia to make interest payments. The Central Bank of Russia increased interest rates to 20%. Requirement for Russian businesses to swap 80% of overseas earnings into rubles. Ban on Russian brokers selling securities owned by foreigners. Restrictions on Russian citizens transferring money abroad. Ploy by President Putin to force gas buyers to pay in rubles. Risks of government intervention in currency manipulation.

The conflict is a major blow to the global economy that will hurt growth and raise prices. Higher prices for commodities like food and energy will push up inflation further, eroding the value of incomes and weighing on demand. Neighboring economies will grapple with disrupted trade, supply chains, and remittances as well as a surge in refugee flows. Reduced business confidence and higher investor uncertainty will weigh on asset prices, tightening financial conditions and potentially spurring capital outflows from emerging markets. Russia and Ukraine are major commodities producers, and disruptions have caused global prices to soar, especially for oil and natural gas. Food costs have jumped, with wheat reaching a record due to disruptions in Ukraine and Russia. Countries with direct trade, tourism, and financial exposures will feel additional pressures. Economies reliant on oil imports will see wider fiscal and trade deficits and more inflation pressure. Steeper price increases for food and fuel may spur a greater risk of unrest in some regions. Growth forecasts are likely to be revised down due to the conflict. The war may fundamentally alter the global economic and geopolitical order. Energy trade, supply chains, payment networks, and reserve currency holdings may be affected. Europe will experience an immense toll, with sanctions on Russia causing a deep recession and fueling inflation. Energy is a critical spillover channel for Europe, as Russia is a major source of natural gas imports. Wider supply-chain disruptions may also adversely affect Europe's recovery from the pandemic. Caucasus and Central Asia will face consequences from Russia's recession and sanctions, affecting trade, remittances, investment, and tourism. Middle East and North Africa will experience ripple effects from higher food and energy prices and tighter financial conditions. Egypt, for example, imports a significant portion of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to the war's effects, including higher energy and food prices, reduced tourism, and difficulty accessing international capital markets. Record wheat prices are concerning for a region that imports a large portion of its supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Latin America and the Caribbean will see significant inflation due to high commodity prices. Central American and Caribbean importers will be negatively impacted by higher oil prices, while exporters of commodities can charge more for their products. The United States will experience rising commodity prices and inflation, which were already high before the conflict. Asia and the Pacific will face slower growth due to the global economic impact, with petroleum importers and nations reliant on Russian tourism being particularly affected. China's immediate effects will be smaller due to fiscal stimulus and limited export exposure to Russia. Japan and Korea will also experience limited effects, while higher energy prices will raise inflation in India. Global shocks highlight the importance of a global safety net and regional arrangements to buffer economies from such events.

There is a lack of understanding of the economic dimensions of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions and business retreats have had a devastating effect on Russia's economy. The Russian government's economic releases are becoming increasingly cherry-picked and incomplete. Excessively rosy economic forecasts have extrapolated data from before the full effect of sanctions. Russia's gas exports cannot be easily redirected to Asia to compensate for Europe. Russian oil exports reflect Putin's diminished economic and geopolitical clout. Russia is not able to replace lost Western businesses and imports with imports from Asia. Russian domestic consumption and consumer health have been negatively impacted. Global businesses have pulled out of Russia, leading to capital and talent flight. Russia is running a budget deficit despite high energy prices. Putin's foreign exchange reserves are decreasing at an alarming rate. The ruble's appreciation is an artificial reflection of capital control measures. The implementation of sanctions and business retreats against Russia is incomplete.

## What are the potential long-term consequences of the international sanctions on the Russian economy?
The potential long-term consequences of the international sanctions on the Russian economy are significant. Firstly, the sanctions have caused a decline in foreign investment and access to foreign capital for Russian businesses. This hampers economic growth and development in the long run. Secondly, the restrictions on the sale of Russian raw materials and energy, as well as the ban on imports of Russian goods, have disrupted trade and led to a decrease in exports. This can have a lasting negative impact on Russia's balance of trade and economic stability. Additionally, the freezing of assets of wealthy Russian citizens and financial sanctions on Russian banks have reduced financial liquidity and confidence in the Russian banking system. This can lead to a credit crunch and liquidity problems for businesses and individuals in the long term. Finally, the long-term consequences of the sanctions include the damage to Russia's reputation as a reliable trading partner and the potential loss of future business opportunities and partnerships with other countries. Overall, the sanctions have the potential to weaken the Russian economy in the long term and hinder its ability to recover and grow.

## How have the disruptions caused by the conflict affected global prices for commodities like food and energy?
The disruptions caused by the conflict have had a significant impact on global prices for commodities like food and energy. Firstly, the conflict has disrupted trade and supply chains, leading to a decrease in the availability of certain commodities. This reduced supply has caused prices to increase. For example, disruptions in Ukraine and Russia have led to higher wheat prices, affecting global food costs. Secondly, the conflict has heightened investor uncertainty and reduced business confidence, leading to volatility in commodity prices. This volatility can further drive up prices as investors seek to protect their investments and hedge against potential risks. Thirdly, the conflict has had a spillover effect on neighboring economies, which rely on trade with Russia and Ukraine. These economies may experience higher inflation and costs as a result, further pushing up global prices for commodities. Overall, the disruptions caused by the conflict have created a ripple effect on global commodity prices, impacting the affordability and availability of essential goods like food and energy.

## What measures can be taken to address the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stabilize the global economy?
To address the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stabilize the global economy, several measures can be taken. Firstly, it is important for the international community to maintain and strengthen the existing sanctions on Russia. This will put further economic pressure on Russia and incentivize a change in behavior. Additionally, efforts should be made to diversify energy sources and reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. This can be achieved through increased investment in renewable energy and the development of alternative energy supply routes. Furthermore, support should be provided to affected countries and regions to mitigate the negative economic consequences of the conflict. This can include financial assistance, trade facilitation, and efforts to restore disrupted supply chains. Finally, diplomatic efforts should be intensified to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict and create a stable environment for economic recovery. These measures, combined with international cooperation and coordination, can help stabilize the global economy and address the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
