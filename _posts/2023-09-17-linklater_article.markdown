## How does the concept of shooting a film over the course of 20 years impact the storytelling and audience experience?
The concept of shooting a film over the course of 20 years has a profound impact on the storytelling and audience experience.

One of the challenges is to ensure continuity and believability in the aging process. This requires careful planning and the use of makeup, prosthetics, and visual effects to realistically portray the physical changes that occur as the characters age. However, these challenges also present opportunities for creative storytelling. The gradual aging of the actors can be used as a narrative device to explore themes of time, identity, and personal growth. It allows the film to delve into the complexities of life and the impact of the passage of time on relationships and ambitions. Additionally, this approach provides a unique opportunity for the actors to grow and evolve with their characters, adding depth and authenticity to their performances.

<p>In a recent interview with NME, director Richard Linklater expressed his admiration for Greta Gerwig's record-breaking 'Barbie' and shared his thoughts on his own upcoming musical project, 'Merrily We Roll Along'. Linklater specifically praised the musical numbers in 'Barbie', including the catchy tune 'I'm Just Ken' performed by Ryan Gosling.</p>
<p>Linklater believes that 'Barbie' is one of the best things that has happened to cinema recently. Despite its grand scale, he is not concerned about making films on the same level as 'Barbie'. Instead, he is focused on his ambitious musical comedy, 'Merrily We Roll Along'.</p>
<p>'Merrily We Roll Along' is an adaptation of the popular musical of the same name, which has been in production since 2019. The film, set to be released in approximately 2040, follows the story of a talented Broadway composer named Franklin Shepard, played by Paul Mescal, who abandons his friends and career to become a Hollywood producer. The unique aspect of this project is that it is being shot over the course of 20 years, allowing the audience to witness the passage of time in real-time.</p>
<p>But this epic project is not without its challenges. Aging the young actors up throughout the years has been a complex task. However, Linklater sees this as an opportunity to explore the concept of aging backwards and create a thought-provoking narrative.</p>
<p>Greta Gerwig, the creator of 'Barbie', also had a vision of creating something wild and unruly, with an emotional authenticity. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, has been praised as a joyful, maximalist, and deeply weird confection.</p>

However, 'Barbie' and 'Merrily We Roll Along' are projects that have excited everyone involved. Collaborators are eager to break away from the conventions and do something out of the box, an act of faith in the power of cinema.</p>
<p>With 'Barbie' being re-released in IMAX theaters on September 22, 2023, audiences can experience the magic of this whimsical film in all its glory. Although the popularity of another film, 'Oppenheimer', has overshadowed 'Barbie' in IMAX theaters, the impact of Gerwig's creation is undeniable.</p>
<p>Richard Linklater's filmography is filled with remarkable works, including 'Dazed and Confused,' the 'Before' trilogy, 'Boyhood,' 'The School of Rock,' 'Everybody Wants Some!,' 'Waking Life,' and 'Bernie'. His talent and deep appreciation for the art of filmmaking shine through in every project.</p>
<p>As Linklater continues to push boundaries and challenge the norms, his dedication to 'Barbie' and 'Merrily We Roll Along' proves that he is a visionary director with a passion for creating cinema that leaves a lasting impact.
