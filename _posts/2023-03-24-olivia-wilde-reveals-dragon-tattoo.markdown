Olivia Wilde's 39th birthday was two weeks ago, but she recently shared a picture of the tattoo she's had for 26 years, which is a dragon on her buttocks. The tattoo was her first, which she got when she was just 13 years old. Wilde shared a photo with her friend Molly Howard on the beach and joked about how it's not another tramp stamp. Wilde revealed in a 2017 interview with Craig Ferguson that she has a bad-tattoo club, and the dragon tattoo was the first one she got. Although it had a lot of significance at the time, she now thinks it's hideous. Wilde also has delicate designs on her inner forearms representing the Libra and Taurus constellations, the signs of her daughter and son, respectively, courtesy of celeb tattoo artist Dr. Woo. She hints that she might be getting a chest tattoo soon, as she took a selfie with Jennifer Coolidge and wrote on Instagram that she was moving this pic to the grid and then to a chest tattoo most likely.

## AI predict: The future of tattoos
Well, it seems like Olivia is not very happy with her dragon tattoo anymore, but the good news is that tattoos can be removed. So, I predict that in the future, more people will start getting tattoos that they can remove or change easily. Maybe we will even see the development of temporary tattoos that last for a longer period of time. The possibilities are endless!
