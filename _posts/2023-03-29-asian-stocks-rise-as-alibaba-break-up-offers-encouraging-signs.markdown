Welcome to today's financial news, where we bring you the latest updates on the markets and economic trends. In a sign of relief for investors, Asian stocks rose on Thursday, with fears easing on the banking front and the prospect of a break-up at Chinese conglomerate Alibaba offering encouraging signs that Beijing's regulatory storm focused on tech companies might finally be clearing.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained for a third day in a row, rising 0.3%. This follows the positive trend seen in overnight Wall Street indexes, which jumped after the U.S. banks' top cop appeared before Congress and focused remarks on failures at Silicon Valley Bank and its supervision, rather than broader systemic issues across the financial sector.

The U.S. dollar was firm, particularly against the safe-haven Japanese yen, as investors wound back some of the safety positions built up in the last couple of weeks. The yen last traded at 132.75 to the dollar. From the two-year tenor all the way to 30-year, U.S. yields are below the current Fed funds rate of roughly 4.8% as markets have dramatically repriced the rates outlook.

The rates-sensitive Nasdaq is heading for its best quarter in more than two years. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures were steady on Thursday. This is a positive sign for markets, as investors are showing renewed confidence in tech stocks.

Investors extended a rally in Alibaba's Hong Kong shares as a conference call offered more details on the company's plan to spin off its businesses. The stock, which hit above HK$300 in 2020, traded at HK$96.30 on Thursday. The broader Hang Seng rose 0.2%. This is a significant development, as Alibaba has been at the center of Beijing's regulatory crackdown on tech companies in recent months.

Brent oil futures steadied at $78.18 a barrel, while gold, which has surged over the past few weeks, was under gentle pressure at $1,958 an ounce. This suggests that investors are cautiously optimistic about the future of the markets.

Overall, the news from Asia is positive, with investors showing renewed confidence in the markets. The tech sector, in particular, is showing signs of a rebound, with the Nasdaq heading for its best quarter in more than two years. While there are still uncertainties in the global economy, it seems that investors are becoming more optimistic about the future.
