In today's midday trading news, several companies are making headlines with significant developments and financial updates.

Roblox shares have dropped significantly after missing second-quarter estimates. The company reported a loss of 46 cents per share and net bookings of $780.7 million, missing analysts' estimates. Waning demand and intensifying competition in the online gaming industry are contributing factors. However, Roblox plans to generate revenue from advertising initiatives and has a robust pipeline of AI innovations.

Penn Entertainment has formed a partnership with Disney-owned ESPN to rebrand its sportsbook as ESPN Bet. The deal, worth $1.5 billion, marks ESPN's first agreement with a sports betting firm. Penn Entertainment had previously purchased a stake in Barstool Sports and later sold it back to Dave Portnoy for $1 and a share of future proceeds.

Upstart's shares have experienced a significant drop of 34% due to disappointing guidance. The company has trimmed its revenue forecast for the year. However, Upstart remains focused on reinforcing its competitive position and reducing costs.

Lyft's shares have fallen 10% following the release of its second-quarter earnings. While the company beat revenue expectations, it lowered its revenue forecast for the first quarter. Lyft intends to strengthen its market position and explore cost-cutting measures, including potential layoffs.

Rivian's stock has slipped 9.9% despite reporting a smaller-than-expected loss. The electric vehicle manufacturer is facing challenges in a competitive market. It aims to improve its profitability and expand its customer base.

Carvana's stock has slipped nearly 6% despite better-than-expected third-quarter guidance. The company continues to focus on growth and enhancing the customer experience.

Twilio's stock has risen 2.2% after beating second-quarter earnings expectations. The cloud communications platform reported adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share and revenue of $1.04 billion. Twilio expects strong performance in the third quarter with a projected revenue range of $980 million to $990 million.

Celsius Holdings has soared 20.5% after exceeding analysts' expectations in the second quarter. The company's stock closed at $88.36, reflecting a 0.81% gain over the past month. Celsius Holdings is projected to report increased earnings and revenue, reflecting its positive business outlook.

Toast has gained 14.6% after reporting higher-than-expected revenue for the second quarter. The company offers software and fintech solutions to restaurants, with financial services generating a significant portion of its revenue. Toast recently filed a new S-1 document, indicating a higher IPO price range.

Super Micro Computer's shares have cratered over 23% despite reporting strong quarterly earnings. The company reported earnings per share of $1.63, lower than analysts' expectations of $1.71. Super Micro Computer is targeting increased demand for AI-related hardware.

Bumble's stock has slid over 7% due to weak expectations for adjusted EBITDA. The company, which operates a popular dating app, is working to improve its financial performance.

Akamai Technologies' shares have jumped 8.5% following better-than-expected quarterly results. The cybersecurity company forecasts strong revenue and profit for the third quarter, driven by increased demand for cloud security services.

Axon Enterprise's stock has risen 14% on strong quarterly results and increased full-year guidance. The company, known for its conducted energy devices, operates through Software and Sensors. Axon Enterprise is targeting cost reduction and enhancing free cash flow conversion.

IAC's stock has sunk over 16% due to disappointing quarterly results. The company reported lower-than-expected earnings, prompting market reactions.

Marqeta's shares have surged 12% after announcing a deal to continue servicing Block's CashApp. Marqeta, a card issuing and transaction processing services provider, has expanded its clientele with a new contract to serve a fintech backed by Walmart. The company reported solid revenue growth in the third quarter and is actively renegotiating contracts.
