## What are the best seats for nervous flyers?
For nervous flyers, the best seats to choose are over the wing or in the front rows. The pilot usually avoids turbulence from the front of the plane, making these seats less bumpy. Additionally, seats in the first row behind the wall separating business class or premium economy from coach provide extra privacy and space, which can help calm nervous flyers.

## What are the options for extra legroom on a plane?
If you're looking for extra legroom, there are a few options to consider. Bulkhead seats and emergency exit row seats typically offer the most legroom. However, it's important to note that emergency exit row seats often come with an extra fee. Another tip for getting extra legroom is to choose seats at the front of the plane. These seats are often in high demand and may require early booking or an upgrade to secure.

## How can you increase your chances of securing a preferred seat?
To increase your chances of securing a preferred seat, there are a few strategies you can employ. Firstly, consider upgrading to a higher class of service that offers more desirable seating options. This can give you access to business class or premium economy seats with extra legroom and other perks. Secondly, make sure to book your ticket early. The earlier you book, the more options you'll have for seat selection. Thirdly, some airlines offer the option to pay extra for preferred seats with extra legroom or other amenities. If securing your preferred seat is a priority, this may be worth considering. Additionally, checking in early and keeping an eye out for seat upgrade opportunities during online check-in or at the airport can also increase your chances of getting your desired seat.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the main sources and extra sources of information to help you navigate the world of airplane seating. We'll uncover tips and tricks for choosing the best seat based on your needs and preferences, and we'll debunk common myths about airplane seating.</p>
<p>Best Seats for Different Travelers</p>
<p>For Nervous Flyers</p>
<p>If you're a nervous flyer, you'll be relieved to know that there are seats specifically designed to minimize the effects of turbulence. According to a flight attendant, the best place to sit to avoid turbulence is over the wing. The pilot is likely avoiding turbulence from the front of the plane, making seats in the front rows also a good option for nervous flyers. Additionally, seats in the first row behind the wall separating business class or premium economy from coach are ideal for parents flying with infants, as they provide extra privacy and space.</p>
<p>For Extra Legroom</p>
<p>If you value extra legroom, there are a few options to consider. Bulkhead seats and emergency exit row seats typically offer the most legroom. However, it's important to note that emergency exit row seats often come with an extra fee. Another tip for getting extra legroom is to choose seats at the front of the plane.</p>
<p>For Sleeping</p>
<p>If you're planning on getting some shut-eye during your flight, window seats in a bulkhead row are your best bet. These seats provide both privacy and a spot to rest your head. Just be aware that bassinet seats, which are located near the bulkhead, may be noisy due to crying babies.</p>
<p>For Traveling with Kids</p>
<p>Flying with young children can be a challenge, but choosing the right seats can make the experience a little smoother. For families with two adults and two children, it's best to sit two-by-two, with one parent and child seated in the aisle and middle seat, and the other parent and child in the seats directly behind. If your children are antsy about getting on and off the plane, it's recommended to sit near the front for quicker boarding and deplaning. And if your kids are still in diapers, consider sitting near the back of the plane for easy access to changing tables.</p>
