## How has the cyclical nature of Bali's tourism industry affected the local workforce?
The cyclical nature of Bali's tourism industry has a significant impact on the local workforce. During the peak season, when tourists flock to the island and hotels are bustling, there is a high demand for workers. This creates employment opportunities and brings in income for many locals. However, during the off-season, when tourist arrivals decline, many workers face uncertainty and a decrease in income. They may struggle to find stable employment and have to rely on savings or other sources of income. This cyclical nature of the industry creates a challenging environment for the local workforce, as they have to navigate periods of high demand and stability followed by periods of low demand and uncertainty.

## What are the risks that workers in Bali's tourism industry face?
Workers in Bali's tourism industry face various risks and challenges. First and foremost, there are physical risks associated with certain jobs in the industry. For example, lifeguards put their lives on the line to ensure the safety of beachgoers, facing the danger of accidents and drowning. Adventure tour guides also face risks when leading thrilling excursions, such as hiking or water sports. Secondly, there are occupational hazards faced by housekeepers and maintenance staff in hotels and resorts. They often have to perform physically demanding tasks and may be exposed to chemicals or other hazardous substances. Finally, the industry is vulnerable to external shocks, as seen with events like the Bali bombings and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. These shocks can lead to job losses and economic hardship for workers. Overall, workers in Bali's tourism industry face a range of risks, both physical and economic.

## What are the challenges faced by nail salon workers in Bali and how can their rights and safety be protected?
Nail salon workers in Bali face various challenges, and it is crucial to protect their rights and safety. One major challenge is the misclassification of employment status. Some nail salon workers may be classified as independent contractors instead of employees, which can lead to a lack of protections and benefits. They may not have access to health insurance or paid leave, and their working hours and wages may be less regulated. Another challenge is the health hazards associated with the chemicals used in salons. Nail salon workers are exposed to these chemicals on a daily basis, which can lead to respiratory and skin problems. It is important to implement safety measures, such as proper ventilation systems and protective equipment, to ensure their health and well-being. Additionally, there is a need for fair working conditions in the nail salon industry. This includes reasonable working hours, fair wages, and opportunities for career advancement. By addressing these challenges and promoting occupational health and safety, we can protect the rights and well-being of nail salon workers in Bali.

# Challenges and Resilience: Stories from Bali's Workers

In the tropical paradise of Bali, where the azure waters and breathtaking landscapes attract millions of tourists each year, the realities of the local workforce often go unnoticed. Behind the scenes, the workers of Bali's tourism industry face a range of challenges, from the cyclical nature of the industry to external shocks and risks associated with their jobs. However, amidst these challenges, stories of resilience and innovation emerge, showcasing the strength of the human spirit.

## The Cyclical Nature of Bali's Tourism Industry

One of the defining characteristics of Bali's tourism industry is its cyclical nature. The ebb and flow of tourists throughout the year create both peaks and troughs in employment opportunities. During the busy season, hotels and resorts are bustling with activity, and workers are in high demand. However, during the off-season, many workers face uncertainty and a decrease in income.

## External Shocks and their Impact

Bali has faced several external shocks throughout its history, which have had a significant impact on the tourism industry and the local workforce. The infamous Bali bombings, the eruption of Mount Agung, and most recently, the coronavirus pandemic, have all dealt severe blows to tourism in the region. Each of these events has led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, resulting in job losses and economic hardship for many.

## Risks Faced by Bali's Workers

Working in Bali's tourism industry can be physically and emotionally demanding. From the risks associated with certain jobs, such as lifeguards ensuring the safety of beachgoers or adventure tour guides leading exhilarating excursions, to the occupational hazards faced by housekeepers and maintenance staff in hotels and resorts, workers often put their well-being on the line to provide unforgettable experiences for visitors.

## Employment Contracts and Social Safety Nets

Another challenge that Bali's workers face is the differences in employment contracts and social safety nets. As the case of the elevator accident involving housekeepers highlights, some workers may be left without adequate protection in the event of an accident or injury. The lack of standardized employment contracts and comprehensive social safety nets can leave workers vulnerable and without recourse.

## High Salaries for Foreign Staff in Bali Resorts

While many workers in the tourism industry struggle with low wages and precarious employment conditions, there is also a disparity in salaries between local and foreign staff in Bali resorts. Some resorts are able to pay high salaries to their foreign employees, creating a divide in the industry. This gap in wages further exacerbates the challenges faced by local workers and highlights the need for fair and equitable compensation.

## Aquaculture Provides Fallback for People of the Penida Archipelago

Away from the bustling tourist hubs, on the Penida Archipelago, a different story unfolds. Seaweed farming was once the main industry on the islands, providing a livelihood for the local population. However, with the rise of tourism in Indonesia, the demand for seaweed declined. Now, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, seaweed farming is experiencing a resurgence as tourists are scarce, providing a fallback for the people of Penida as they await the return of visitors.

## Sustainable Solutions for the Seaweed Farming Industry

Efforts are being made to develop sustainable products from seaweed, such as edible cups. These innovative solutions not only benefit the local economy but also contribute to the global effort towards environmentally friendly practices. Furthermore, the seaweed farming industry in Penida could benefit from local processing and value addition, creating more opportunities for the local workforce and increasing the resilience of the industry.

## Surviving the Pandemic: Stories from Sudaji Village

In Sudaji Village, amidst the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, stories of resilience and community spirit emerge. Homestay owners, who started developing their businesses to cater to tourists, found themselves facing cancellations and a sharp decline in sales. However, they adapted and survived through various means. From planting vegetables to sustain themselves during lockdowns to receiving help from former overseas guests, the people of Sudaji Village showcase their ability to overcome adversity.

## Bali's Hospitality Workers Return to their Roots

As the pandemic wreaked havoc on Bali's tourism industry, hotel employees and other hospitality workers found themselves without jobs. Returning to their home villages, they turned to their families and their ancestral land for support. Bali's strong family ties and Hindu culture provided a safety net for many, as workers worked on their family farm plots, helping to sustain themselves during these challenging times.

## The Economic Impact of the Bali Bombings

The Bali bombings of 2002 had a devastating impact on the tourism industry and the local population. Foreign arrivals fell drastically, causing a sharp decline in tourism-related businesses. Many lost their jobs, and businesses were forced to implement cost-cutting measures, such as reduced working hours and pay cuts. The bombings served as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of Bali's tourism industry to external shocks.

## Nail Salon Worker Rights and Hazards

Beyond the tourism industry, Bali is also home to a thriving nail salon scene. However, the rights and safety of nail salon workers are often overlooked. From the misclassification of employment status to the health hazards associated with the chemicals used in salons, workers face numerous challenges. Ensuring fair working conditions and promoting occupational health and safety in the nail salon industry is crucial for protecting the well-being of these workers.

## Stories of Resilience

Amidst the challenges, the people of Bali's workers showcase their resilience and determination. From adapting their livelihoods to the changing tourism landscape to finding innovative solutions for sustainable industries, they demonstrate the strength of the human spirit. While the road ahead may be uncertain, the stories of Bali's workers serve as a reminder that with resilience and determination, we can overcome even the most formidable challenges.
