U.S. regulators have announced plans to require regional banks to issue debt and strengthen their 'living wills.' The new requirements aim to protect the public in the event of bank failures. The move comes after the regional banking crisis in March, which led to the collapse of three institutions and impacted the earnings of many others. 

The proposal will apply measures that typically apply to global systemically important banks (GSIBs) to banks with at least $100 billion in assets. The requirements will create moderately higher funding costs for regional banks, although they will have three years to conform to the new rule once enacted. Many banks already hold acceptable forms of debt. Analysts predict that the debt requirements will have a significant impact on bank shareholders, with some banks needing to raise fresh debt. Having long-term debt on hand improves depositors' confidence and reduces costs to the FDIC's own Deposit Insurance Fund.

In response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March and emerging risks in the banking system, regulators plan to raise levels of long-term debt held by banks and remove loopholes that allowed banks to avoid recognition of declines in bond holdings. The proposed changes aim to discourage banks from holding the debt of other lenders to reduce contagion risk.

U.S. regulators also plan to force banks to develop more robust 'living wills' in case of failure. This will involve updating guidance on monitoring risks and deposit insurance pricing. The goal is to provide regulators with more options in the event of a bank failure.

The debt requirements are expected to have a broad impact on bank shareholders. Banks may need to issue more corporate bonds or replace existing funding sources with more expensive long-term debt. This could squeeze margins and reduce earnings for mid-sized banks. Regions, M&T Bank, Citizens Financial, Northern Trust, and Fifth Third Bancorp are among the banks that may need to raise fresh debt.

The new regulations are accepting comments from the public until the end of November. The final rule is set to be implemented by September 30, 2022.

The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its implementing regulations are also shaping the landscape of the financial industry. The Act focuses on beneficial ownership information reporting and individual FinCEN identifiers. Proposed collections for these reports and identifiers were announced on January 17, 2023.

In the technology industry, several events have taken place recently. A company announces a new product launch, the CEO gives a keynote speech at a technology conference, the company celebrates its 10th anniversary, the company wins an industry award, the company partners with a major technology company, and the company acquires a smaller competitor. These events showcase the company's growth and success.

Overall, the new requirements for regional banks to strengthen funding and 'living wills' aim to enhance the stability and resilience of the banking system. The regulations will impose higher funding costs on regional banks, but they are essential to protect the public and reduce the risks of bank failures. The implementation of these requirements will have a significant impact on bank shareholders and may necessitate the issuance of fresh debt by some banks. The broader financial industry is also witnessing changes with the implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act and the various events in the technology sector.

## How will the new requirements for regional banks to issue debt and strengthen their 'living wills' protect the public in the event of bank failures?
The new requirements for regional banks to issue debt and strengthen their 'living wills' will protect the public in the event of bank failures by enhancing the stability and resilience of the banking system. Regional banks will be required to hold long-term debt, which improves depositors' confidence and reduces costs to the FDIC's own Deposit Insurance Fund. This means that in the event of a bank failure, there will be sufficient funds to cover depositors' accounts and prevent disruptions to the financial system. Additionally, the development of more robust 'living wills' will provide regulators with more options and guidance in handling bank failures, allowing for a more orderly resolution and minimizing the impact on the public.

## What impact will the debt requirements have on bank shareholders and how will it affect their earnings?
The debt requirements will have a significant impact on bank shareholders and their earnings. Banks will need to raise fresh debt or replace existing funding sources with more expensive long-term debt. This could squeeze margins and reduce earnings, especially for mid-sized banks. Shareholders may see a decline in profitability and returns on their investments. However, the implementation of these requirements is crucial to protecting the public and reducing the risks of bank failures. By strengthening the financial health of regional banks, the long-term stability of the banking system is preserved, which ultimately benefits shareholders in the form of a more resilient and secure banking industry.

## How will the implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act and its regulations shape the financial industry?
The implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act and its regulations will have a significant impact on the financial industry. The Act focuses on beneficial ownership information reporting and individual FinCEN identifiers, aiming to improve transparency and combat financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorism financing. The regulations will require financial institutions to collect and report detailed information on the beneficial owners of companies, increasing accountability and deterring illicit activities. This will reshape the financial industry by imposing stricter compliance requirements, enhancing due diligence processes, and strengthening anti-money laundering measures. It will contribute to a more transparent and secure financial system, fostering trust among investors, customers, and regulatory authorities.
