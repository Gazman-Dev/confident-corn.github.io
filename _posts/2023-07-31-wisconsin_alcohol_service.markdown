Wisconsin is one of several states where lawmakers are proposing to lower the minimum age for alcohol service, citing labor shortages and the desire to provide work experience for young people. Critics argue that this move puts children at risk and undermines labor protections.

In the small town of Freedom, Wisconsin, Buzz's Pub and Grill – a local sports bar whose logo features frothing beer mugs in the colors of the American flag – has been short-staffed since the pandemic. A new proposal in Wisconsin would lower the minimum age for alcohol service to 14 years old. Lawmakers behind the bill argue that it would alleviate the labor shortage and provide valuable work experience to young people.

Opponents of the bill argue that exposing children to the potential dangers of working in bars and restaurants is unconscionable and undermines labor protections. Similar proposals to lower the alcohol service age have been enacted in other states, including West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Restaurant lobbying groups support these proposals as part of an effort to cut labor costs and deregulate employment.

Child labor violations have been on the rise in recent years, with children working in hazardous jobs. Lowering the alcohol service age could put teenage girls at a higher risk of abuse and harassment in the workplace. Supporters of the bill argue that there are safeguards in place to protect young workers, such as supervision and training. Opponents argue that the bill is driven by restaurant industry groups that benefit from child labor and aim to avoid raising wages and improving working conditions. Critics see the bills as a missed opportunity to address the root causes of the labor shortage, such as childcare, parental leave, and prison reform.

The commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industry has established some occupations as hazardous for workers under the age of 18. There is work that is prohibited for minors under the age of 16. Those under the age of 18 are prohibited from work involving hazardous materials. Those under the age of 18 are prohibited from work involving hazardous operations and machinery. Those under the age of 18 are prohibited from work involving liquor. Those under the age of 18 are prohibited from work involving tobacco. Those under the age of 18 are prohibited from work involving transportation. There are exceptions to the prohibited-work limitations. For more information, contact dli.laborstandards@state.mn.us or call 651-284-5075 or 800-342-5354.

Binge Drinking - Percent of young people drinking 5+ drinks at one time in the last 2 weeks. Average age of first use of alcohol in 2003 was about 14, compared to about 17 1/2 in 1965. People who start drinking before the age of 15 are four times more likely to meet criteria for alcohol dependence. Younger children and adolescents who start drinking are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. Adolescence is a key risk factor for starting to drink and drinking dangerously. Brain development in adolescence may explain risk-taking behavior and lack of recognition of consequences. Expectancies and beliefs about alcohol influence drinking behavior in adolescence. Adolescents are more sensitive to the positive effects of drinking and have higher tolerance. Personality characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity may increase risk for alcohol problems. Hereditary factors, such as genetics and family history, contribute to alcohol problems in adolescents. Environmental factors, such as influence of parents and peers, also play a role in alcohol use. Potential health risks of heavy drinking in adolescence include brain effects, liver effects, growth and endocrine effects.

Federal, State, and local laws shape alcohol policy in the United States. Alcohol policy governs the manufacturing and selling of alcohol. Alcohol policy determines who can drink alcohol. Alcohol policy addresses alcohol-related problems. The 21st Amendment repealed national prohibition and gave States control over alcohol policy. States decide whether to allow sale and importation of alcohol. States determine how alcohol is distributed and possessed within the State. Some States grant local governments control over alcohol policy. Congress can use financial and tax incentives to promote certain alcohol policies. The Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984 sets the minimum legal drinking age to 21. States that do not comply with the minimum legal drinking age risk losing ten percent of Federal funding for highways. State laws may differ on possession and exceptions to the minimum legal drinking age.

Seven states have passed laws to lower the minimum age for serving alcohol in restaurants since 2021. Some of those laws decrease the threshold to 16, 17 or 18. There is a proposal in Wisconsin to lower the age all the way to 14. The restaurant industry is looking to fill positions with younger workers and pay lower wages. Advocates are concerned that serving alcohol could make younger teens more vulnerable to harassment and exploitation. Some in the restaurant industry believe that lowering the age requirement will open doors for teens. The Iowa Restaurant Association supported a state law that lowers the alcohol service age from 18 to 16. The Iowa law has guardrails in place to protect teens, including adult supervision and parental consent.
