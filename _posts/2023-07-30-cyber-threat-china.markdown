Suspected Chinese malware has been identified in several US military systems, with the intent to disrupt operations rather than surveil. The malware could also have the ability to disrupt normal civilian life or businesses. Investigations into Chinese malware had been underway for several months prior, and experts say that China is persistent in its efforts to penetrate governments and critical infrastructure. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue of Chinese hacking while meeting with Chinese diplomats. The Biden administration is working to defend critical infrastructure from any disruptions.

The cyber threat posed by China is described as the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to US government and private-sector networks. China's cyber pursuits and export of related technologies increase the threats of aggressive cyber operations against the US homeland. China is capable of launching cyber attacks that could disrupt critical infrastructure services in the United States, including oil and gas pipelines and rail systems. Organizations must take urgent action to understand and address the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Chinese cyber actors. Investing in the operational resilience of essential services is important for detecting, preventing, and responding to cyber incidents. CISA and other US government agencies provide timely and actionable information about the Chinese cyber threat. Organizations should prioritize effective cybersecurity measures to defend against the PRC cyber threat.

Additionally, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's 2023 Annual Threat Assessment highlights the cyber threat posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC). China is considered the most active and persistent cyber espionage threat to US government and private-sector networks. China's cyber pursuits and export of related technologies increase the threats of aggressive cyber operations against the US homeland. China is capable of launching cyber attacks that could disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States. Organizations must understand and address known tactics, techniques, and procedures used by PRC cyber actors. Efforts should be made to detect and prevent intrusions, respond to and recover from incidents, and invest in the operational resilience of essential services. CISA and other government agencies provide timely and actionable information about the PRC cyber threat. Organizations should prioritize effective cybersecurity measures to mitigate the PRC cyber threat.

In light of these concerns, CISA's Shields Up campaign provides recommendations, products, and resources to increase organizational vigilance. CISA encourages organizations to adopt a heightened posture when it comes to cybersecurity. It also encourages stakeholders to voluntarily share information about cyber-related events. CISA is the nation's cyber defense agency.

The Biden administration acknowledges the seriousness of the Chinese cyber threat and is working to enhance the cyber resilience of critical infrastructure. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks, organizations and government agencies must remain vigilant and prioritize effective cybersecurity measures to protect against the cyber threat posed by China.
