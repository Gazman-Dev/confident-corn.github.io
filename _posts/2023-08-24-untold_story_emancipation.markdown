## How did the delayed freedom of enslaved people in Texas impact their lives and communities?
The delayed freedom of enslaved people in Texas had a profound impact on their lives and communities. Despite the Emancipation Proclamation being issued on January 1, 1863, it took more than two years for the news to reach Texas. During this time, enslaved people in Texas continued to live in bondage, unaware that they were legally free. This delay not only prolonged their suffering but also deprived them of the opportunity to begin building new lives and communities as free individuals. When Union troops finally arrived in Galveston Bay on June 19, 1865, and announced their freedom, it was a moment of immense joy and celebration for the newly freed people. However, the delayed freedom had lasting consequences. Many had already been subjected to physical and emotional abuse during their time in bondage, and the delay only added to their trauma. Additionally, the delayed freedom meant that they had missed out on valuable time to gain education, skills, and resources that could have helped them in their transition to freedom. Despite these challenges, the newly freed people in Texas demonstrated resilience and determination as they worked together to rebuild their lives and communities. They established schools, churches, and mutual aid societies, and fought for their rights and equality. The impact of the delayed freedom can still be felt today, as Juneteenth continues to be celebrated as a significant commemoration of freedom and serves as a reminder of the injustices of slavery.

## What are some alternative approaches to seclusion and restraint in the treatment of mental and/or substance use disorders?
In the treatment of mental and/or substance use disorders, there are alternative approaches to seclusion and restraint that focus on providing compassionate and person-centered care. One alternative approach is the use of trauma-informed care. Trauma-informed care recognizes the impact of trauma on individuals and aims to create a safe and supportive environment that promotes healing and recovery. It emphasizes the importance of building trust, empowering individuals to make choices about their treatment, and addressing the root causes of their mental and/or substance use disorders. Another alternative approach is the use of evidence-based therapies. These therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy, focus on addressing the underlying thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that contribute to mental and/or substance use disorders. They help individuals develop coping skills, manage triggers, and build resilience. Additionally, peer support programs have shown promise as an alternative approach. Peer support programs involve individuals with lived experience of mental and/or substance use disorders providing support and guidance to others who are going through similar challenges. This peer-to-peer approach can be empowering and help individuals feel understood and supported. It is essential to prioritize these alternative approaches and move away from seclusion and restraint, as they can retraumatize individuals, undermine their dignity, and impede their recovery process.

## How can understanding the history of traumatic events help us prevent and address similar issues in the present and future?
Understanding the history of traumatic events is crucial for preventing and addressing similar issues in the present and future. By studying historical traumatic events, we can identify patterns, root causes, and the consequences of such events. This knowledge allows us to develop strategies and interventions to prevent similar events from occurring. For example, studying the history of war and its impact on communities can inform efforts to promote peace and resolve conflicts peacefully. Understanding the history of racial injustices and discrimination can guide efforts to combat systemic racism and promote social justice. Furthermore, the history of trauma can help us recognize and respond to the needs of individuals and communities who have experienced similar events. It allows us to develop trauma-informed practices and policies that prioritize safety, support, and healing. By learning from history, we can work towards creating a more resilient and compassionate society that is better equipped to prevent and address traumatic events in the present and future.
