# Trump to Speak at Mar-a-Lago on Day of Expected Arraignment

Former President Donald Trump is set to speak at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on the same day as his arraignment in Manhattan on Tuesday. The arraignment is related to a hush money probe and is expected to reveal charges related to the $130,000 payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.

Despite facing criminal charges, Trump is considering using his indictment as a rallying cry for his potential 2024 presidential run. However, some Republicans have expressed concern about his legal troubles and their potential impact on the party.

Trump is scheduled to return from the Manhattan courthouse where he is expected to surrender before the arraignment. It is uncertain if he will be required to post bail due to changes in New York's bail laws, but his lawyers have reportedly been in discussions with prosecutors about the matter.

This marks the first time in US history that a former president is facing criminal charges after a grand jury voted to indict him. Multiple reports suggest that Trump is facing more than 30 charges related to tax fraud.
