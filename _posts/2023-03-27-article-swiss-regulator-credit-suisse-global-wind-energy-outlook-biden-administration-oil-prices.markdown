Swiss regulator FINMA has instructed Credit Suisse to write down its AT1 bonds, which are part of the lender's emergency sale to UBS, saying it was a "viability event." FINMA instructed Credit Suisse to write down 16 billion Swiss francs of AT1 bonds, regarded as relatively risky investments, to zero, while equity shareholders will receive payouts at the stock's takeover value. After its share price plunged to an all-time low, Credit Suisse announced that it had secured a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank. The deal creates a business with more than $5tn in invested assets, but UBS has said it will look to downsize some parts of the acquired Credit Suisse businesses.

The global outlook for wind energy is positive as the need for secure energy supplies and climate targets drive growth, according to a report by the Global Wind Energy Council. The report projected that by 2027, 680 GW of new global onshore and offshore wind will be installed, which is enough to power 657 million homes annually. In 2022, the wind-power market stalled due to government policies that encouraged “race to the bottom” pricing, inflation, higher logistics costs, and inefficient permitting and licensing rules. China led the world in both onshore and offshore wind development last year, and is expected to continue to lead in 2023, according to the report. The US is also pushing for offshore wind to be developed as a green-energy replacement for coal, oil, and gas. 

The Biden administration has announced the first-ever lease sale for offshore wind power in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Interior Department will open over 300,000 acres in the Gulf. The Biden administration's 30-gigawatt goal relies largely on using platforms anchored to the sea bottom, with power transported to shore and distributed locally from there. The effort is part of a broader goal of reducing US carbon emissions by 50% by 2030.

Oil prices experienced their biggest daily rally since October as a disruption to supply from Turkey added to easing concerns about the banking crisis. West Texas Intermediate futures traded at around $73 a barrel after jumping more than 5% on Monday. A legal dispute between Iraq, its semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan and Turkey has halted around 400,000 barrels a day of exports from Ceyhan port, tightening the market. Most market watchers are still betting that China's recovery will accelerate and boost prices later this year, with a top Chinese producer forecasting a surge in demand. However, oil remains on track for a fifth monthly decline as concerns over a potential US recession and resilient Russian energy flows weighed on prices.

## AI Predicts: The Rise of Wind Energy and Offshore Leasing in the Gulf of Mexico
As the world becomes increasingly aware of the need for secure energy supplies and climate targets, the global outlook for wind energy is very positive. The recent report by the Global Wind Energy Council indicates that by 2027, 680 GW of new global onshore and offshore wind will be installed, which is enough to power 657 million homes annually. This growth is also driven by government policies, like the Biden administration's 30-gigawatt goal, which relies largely on offshore wind platforms anchored to the sea bottom, with power transported to shore and distributed locally from there. The Gulf of Mexico is also expected to see an increase in offshore wind leasing, as the Interior Department opens up over 300,000 acres for this purpose. With this shift towards renewable energy, we can expect a significant reduction in carbon emissions, leading to a cleaner, healthier world for future generations.
