  <summary>Full summary</summary>
<p>The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is back for its 48th edition, and it is already shaping up to be an unforgettable event. From star-studded premieres to thought-provoking discussions, TIFF 2023 has something for every film lover. Let's dive into the exciting highlights of this year's festival.</p>
<p>The festival kicked off on September 7th and will run for 11 days in various venues across Toronto's downtown center. The theaters hosting premieres include TIFF Bell Lightbox, Roy Thomson Hall, Royal Alexandra Theatre, Scotiabank Theatre, and the Princess of Wales Theatre. But that's not all - an outdoor experience stretches along King Street West between Peter Street and University Avenue, adding to the festival's vibrant atmosphere.</p>
<p>One of the most anticipated aspects of TIFF is the lineup of world premieres. This year, we can expect a diverse range of films making their debut. Directors like Craig Gillespie, Ellen Kuras, and Tony Goldwyn have exciting projects hitting the screen. 'Dumb Money,' directed by Gillespie and starring Paul Dano and Pete Davidson, promises to be a standout. Ellen Kuras' 'Lee,' featuring Kate Winslet as war photographer Lee Miller, is another film generating buzz. And Tony Goldwyn's 'Ezra,' with Robert De Niro and Rose Byrne, is sure to captivate audiences.</p>
<p>But it's not just about the premieres. TIFF is known for its tribute awards, recognizing outstanding contributions to the film industry. This year, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar will receive the prestigious TIFF Tribute Award. Almodovar's unique storytelling and artistic vision have made him a beloved figure in cinema. His films have often been a highlight of past festivals, and this year is no exception.</p>
<p>TIFF also prides itself on showcasing films from emerging and established actors-turned-directors. Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, and Michael Keaton are among the talented actors presenting their directorial debuts. Their films, 'Woman of the Hour,' 'Poolman,' and 'Knox Goes Away,' respectively, promise to deliver exciting and fresh perspectives.</p>
<p>In addition to the film screenings, TIFF offers a platform for important discussions. The ongoing strikes of actors and writers in Hollywood have cast a shadow over the industry, and TIFF is not immune to their impact. The absence of some A-list stars may be felt, but the festival remains focused on showcasing films to its dedicated audience.</p>
<p>One of the key highlights of TIFF is the People's Choice Award. Voted by the public, this award has become a significant predictor of awards season success. Past winners, including 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'Nomadland,' have gone on to receive Oscar recognition. This year's top contenders include 'The Boy and the Heron,' an animated feature, and 'Rustin,' a historical biopic.</p>
<p>Throughout the festival, TIFF's Festival Street livens up the city with performances, free screenings, and immersive activations. Artists like Nickelback, Sho Madjozi, and The Aubreys will take the stage, adding to the festival's electric atmosphere.</p>
<p>As we reach the end of TIFF 2023, the anticipation builds for the closing night. The documentary 'Sly,' directed by Thom Zimny, provides an intimate and unexpected look at the early life of Sylvester Stallone. Stallone himself will be participating in a discussion about his illustrious career. It's a fitting end to a festival that celebrates the diversity and power of storytelling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Toronto International Film Festival 2023 is a must-attend event for any film enthusiast. With its mix of world premieres, tribute awards, and thought-provoking discussions, TIFF offers a unique and thrilling experience. Despite the challenges posed by ongoing strikes, the festival remains committed to showcasing the best in cinema. So mark your calendars and join us as we celebrate the magic of film at TIFF 2023!</p>
