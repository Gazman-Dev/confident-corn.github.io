## What are the main causes of deaths and disappearances among migrants along migration routes?
The main causes of deaths and disappearances among migrants along migration routes are the dangerous conditions of the journey, including overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, extreme weather conditions, and lack of access to food, water, and medical care. Additionally, migrants often face violence, abuse, and exploitation, both from human traffickers and authorities. The lack of safe and legal migration routes forces migrants to take risky paths, increasing their vulnerability to accidents and criminal activities.

## What specific actions have been taken by countries or organizations to address the issue of missing migrants?
Countries and organizations have taken specific actions to address the issue of missing migrants. For example, some countries have implemented search and rescue operations in high-risk areas, providing assistance and support to migrants in distress. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has launched campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of irregular migration and the importance of regular channels. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have provided humanitarian aid, including medical assistance, shelter, and legal support to migrants. Some countries have also established hotlines and platforms for migrants to report their whereabouts or seek help if they go missing.

## What measures should states prioritize to prevent deaths and ensure the safety of migrants along migration routes?
States should prioritize several measures to prevent deaths and ensure the safety of migrants along migration routes. First and foremost, they should establish safe and legal migration pathways, allowing migrants to migrate in a regulated and orderly manner. This would reduce the reliance on dangerous and irregular migration routes. States should also invest in improving search and rescue capabilities, ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to respond to distress calls and ensure prompt assistance to migrants in need. Collaboration and coordination between countries are essential to address the transnational nature of the issue. Sharing information, intelligence, and best practices can enhance the effectiveness of efforts to locate missing migrants and hold accountable those responsible for their disappearance. Additionally, states should address the root causes of migration by promoting socio-economic development, reducing inequality, and addressing conflicts and instability in migrants' countries of origin. Finally, states should ensure that migrants have access to their rights and protection under international human rights law, including access to justice, basic services, and support systems. By prioritizing these measures, states can save lives and prevent further tragedies along migration routes.

  <summary>Full summary</summary>
Thousands of migrants go missing or die each year along migration routes. In 2018, United Nations Member States committed to 'save lives and establish coordinated international efforts on missing migrants' by adopting the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM). Since the adoption of the GCM, more than 15,000 deaths of migrants have been documented. It is clear that efforts to address the issue of missing migrants cannot be delayed any further.<br><br>The tragic incident occurred during a perilous journey undertaken by migrants seeking better opportunities in Europe. The boat capsized after leaving Fass Boye, a fishing village north of Dakar, on July 10. A Spanish fisherman found the boat floating north of Cape Verde's Sal Island. Thirty-eight people survived the accident, while seven people have been confirmed dead and 56 others are still missing.<br><br>To illustrate the scale and severity of the problem, specific examples and statistics can be included. For instance, over the past eight years, more than 47,000 people have died along migration routes. Many more deaths go unrecorded, and thousands of migrants go missing each year. The disappearance of a relative has devastating consequences for their families.<br><br>It is crucial to highlight the actions that specific countries or organizations have taken to address the issue of missing migrants and prevent further tragedies. For example, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the International Commission on Missing Persons call on States to assume collective responsibility to save lives and prevent migrants from going missing or dying along migration routes. This emphasizes the importance of multi-stakeholder efforts and collaboration between countries to address the issue.<br><br>In addition to calling for action, it is important to provide information on the measures that states should take to address the issue of missing migrants. This can include prioritizing search and rescue operations, supporting humanitarian organizations, assessing the impact of migration-related laws, enabling contact with families, and creating safe and regular migration opportunities. States should also establish transnational mechanisms to search and identify those who have died or gone missing, provide support and redress to the families of missing migrants, and make data on migrant deaths and missing migrants publicly available.<br><br>In conclusion, there is an urgent need to address missing migrants and save lives along migration routes. The tragic incident mentioned at the beginning highlights the dangers faced by migrants on their journey. Efforts must be made to prevent deaths and ensure the safety of migrants. States have a collective responsibility to take action and protect the rights of migrants. By implementing the commitments outlined in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, steps can be taken to provide safer migration pathways and prevent the loss of more lives.
