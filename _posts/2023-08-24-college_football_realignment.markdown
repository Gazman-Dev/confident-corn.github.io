## What are the potential benefits of including universities like Stanford and Cal in the ACC?
Including universities like Stanford and Cal in the ACC can bring several potential benefits. Firstly, it will enhance the academic reputation of the conference. Stanford and Cal are renowned institutions with strong academic programs, and their inclusion will elevate the overall academic standing of the ACC. This can attract more academically focused student-athletes and improve the perception of the conference as a whole. Secondly, the addition of Stanford and Cal will boost the competitiveness of the ACC in football. Both universities have a strong football program with a history of success. Their presence will create more exciting matchups and increase the overall competitiveness of the conference. This can lead to increased viewership, media coverage, and revenue for the ACC. Lastly, the inclusion of Stanford and Cal can also enhance the geographical footprint of the conference. California is a large and diverse state with a significant population. Having teams from California in the ACC can help expand the conference's fan base and reach, attracting more fans and potentially increasing revenue streams through increased ticket sales and merchandise purchases.

## How will the departure of Oregon and Washington affect the Pac-12 conference?
The departure of Oregon and Washington from the Pac-12 conference will have significant implications. Firstly, it will weaken the competitive strength of the Pac-12. Oregon and Washington have been dominant teams in the conference, consistently contending for conference championships and representing the Pac-12 in prestigious bowl games. Their departure will leave a void in terms of top-tier football programs and diminish the overall quality of the conference. This can impact the Pac-12's national reputation and potentially result in decreased media coverage and revenue. Secondly, the departure of Oregon and Washington may also lead to a loss of rivalries within the conference. These two teams have historic rivalries with other Pac-12 schools, and their absence can have a negative impact on the overall fan experience and atmosphere within the conference. Additionally, the departure of two prominent programs may also influence other schools to consider leaving the Pac-12, further destabilizing the conference's future. The Pac-12 will need to take proactive measures to address these challenges, such as recruiting new teams or implementing strategic partnerships, in order to maintain its competitiveness and relevance in the national college football landscape.

## What are the academic implications and concerns for athletes in the midst of conference realignment?
Conference realignment raises several academic implications and concerns for athletes. Firstly, the increased travel demands resulting from conference realignment can negatively affect athletes' academic performance. Longer travel times and increased time spent away from campus can disrupt their schedules, limit study opportunities, and increase fatigue. This can have a detrimental impact on their ability to balance athletics and academics effectively, potentially leading to decreased academic performance and increased stress levels. Secondly, conference realignment can also affect the academic support systems available to athletes. Universities may need to restructure their resources and support staff to accommodate new conference affiliations, potentially disrupting the established support networks that athletes rely on for academic assistance. Lastly, the changes in conference affiliations can also impact the academic recognition and prestige associated with playing in a particular conference. Student-athletes often take pride in representing their conference on a national stage, and a shift in conferences may alter the perception of the academic caliber and competitiveness associated with being a part of a specific conference. It is important for universities and athletic departments to prioritize the academic well-being of athletes amidst conference realignment and ensure that appropriate support systems are in place to mitigate these academic concerns.
