## How does federal funding assist in the recovery efforts after the Hawaii wildfires?
Federal funding assists in the recovery efforts after the Hawaii wildfires by providing financial resources to individuals and families affected by the disaster. This funding can be used for various purposes, such as temporary housing, rebuilding homes, replacing lost belongings, and accessing essential services. It helps alleviate the immediate financial burden faced by the victims and enables them to start the recovery process.

## What are the main challenges faced by emergency responders in containing the wildfires?
The main challenges faced by emergency responders in containing the Hawaii wildfires include limited resources, power outages, and adverse weather conditions. The wildfires have caused power outages on the island, hampering communication and response efforts. Additionally, the strong winds and low humidity have created favorable conditions for the fires to spread rapidly. These challenging conditions make it difficult for firefighters to control the flames and protect affected areas.

## How does the National Disaster Recovery Framework support the recovery process in Hawaii?
The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) supports the recovery process in Hawaii by providing a coordinated and collaborative approach to recovery efforts. The framework emphasizes the restoration and revitalization of the community across various aspects, such as health, social, economic, natural, and environmental. It guides the development of recovery core capabilities and promotes unity of effort among all stakeholders involved. The NDRF also establishes the Recovery Support Functions (RSFs) as a coordinating structure for recovery assistance and ensures unified federal assistance is provided to communities in need. This framework facilitates effective communication and collaboration, enabling a more efficient and comprehensive recovery process in Hawaii.
