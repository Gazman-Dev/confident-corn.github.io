In a shocking turn of events, Carlos De Oliveira, the property manager at Mar-a-Lago, has been charged in a federal case along with Donald Trump and Walt Nauta. The case alleges a plot to hide classified documents at Trump's Florida estate and obstruct government investigators.

The charges against De Oliveira include conspiracy to obstruct justice and lying to investigators. John Irving, De Oliveira's attorney, stated that his client has not yet found a Florida-based attorney, which could potentially delay the arraignment.

This case comes at a time when Trump is already facing another federal investigation regarding his actions after the 2020 election. The video footage from Mar-a-Lago is crucial to the case, as it allegedly shows Nauta moving boxes to hide records at Trump's direction.

The indictment also adds new elements to the legal peril Trump faces. He now faces 32 counts of willfully retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act, as well as eight counts related to alleged efforts to obstruct the investigation. The new charges hold a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

Meanwhile, De Oliveira has been accused of meeting with a Trump Organization employee and asking them to delete security camera video. The employee responded that they did not know how to delete the server and did not believe they had the rights to do so. De Oliveira later asked Nauta, 'What are we going to do?', and their actions have raised suspicions of obstructive conduct in response to the subpoena.

De Oliveira is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday in Miami federal court, while Trump and Nauta will also be re-arraigned on the new indictment. The indictment has added significant new details about Trump's alleged handling of the classified war plan, including sharing it at his club in Bedminster and having it at Mar-a-Lago.

This latest development may not significantly affect Trump's bottom-line sentence if convicted, but it could bolster the narrative prosecutors present to a jury and the public. The Trump campaign has called the new charges 'desperate and flailing', accusing the prosecutor, Smith, of casting about for any way to salvage the case against him.

It is important to note that this is not the only legal trouble Trump is facing. He has also pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels. The charges are part of a broader scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump is accused of purchasing damaging stories about him to keep them under wraps.

In response to these charges, Trump's legal team has offered a detailed defense of his conduct in the classified documents case. They argue that the Justice Department should be ordered to 'stand down' on the probe and involve the legislative branch in the case. Trump's lawyers also emphasize that White House practices for handling classified information differ from other parts of the government and suggest that the case should be handled as a civil matter.

As the investigations against Trump continue, the country is left wondering what the outcome will be. Will justice be served, or will Trump once again find a way to evade it? Only time will tell.
