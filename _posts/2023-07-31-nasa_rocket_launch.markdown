NASA is set to launch a rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on August 1st. The launch will be visible from certain locations in eastern states, and viewers can also watch the launch live-streamed on NASA's website and social media platforms.

If skies are clear, people in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York may be able to see the rocket during the first few minutes of its ascent. The rocket is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, Aug. 1. The launch is part of Northrop Grumman's 19th commercial resupply services mission for NASA, which will deliver science investigations, supplies, and equipment to the International Space Station. Viewing locations on Chincoteague Island and the Atlantic beaches in Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware are recommended for optimal viewing. The NASA Wallops Flight Facility Visitor Center will be open for those who want an up-close view of the launch, and parking is limited, so carpooling is encouraged.

In addition to the rocket launch, NASA's Biological and Physical Sciences Division is conducting research on dwarf tomatoes, gut bacterium, and amorphous metals for space exploration. They are investigating the growth of 'Red Robin' dwarf tomatoes in Veggie hardware at NASA's Kennedy Space Center and studying the effects of spaceflight on plants. Their research aims to help astronauts in space by improving food production systems, studying microbial cells in space, and creating high-performance alloys and coatings for spacecrafts.

Northrop Grumman has successfully launched the Pegasus XL rocket carrying NASA's Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) satellite. This marks their ninth science mission for which the company both built and launched the satellite for NASA.

In other news, Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex has upcoming events and astronaut appearances. Visitors can check the calendar to plan their visit and watch rocket launches at the complex. Please note that only officially confirmed launch dates appear on the event calendar. For more information and updates on upcoming events, visitors can follow Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on Facebook.
