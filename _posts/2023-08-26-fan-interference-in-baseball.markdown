The fan interference rule in baseball was put into place in 1931 to prevent fans from inserting themselves into the game action. If it is determined that a fan has interfered with a live/batted ball or even with a player making a play on the field, the umpire will immediately call time, and the ball will be considered dead. Fan interference can take many different forms, including touching a fair or catchable foul ball, reaching over the outfield wall to catch a potential home run or ground rule double, and interfering with bat and ball boys/girls.

For fans that commit spectator interference, the most likely outcome is that they will be ejected from the stadium for the rest of the game. However, some of baseball's most controversial calls have been due to fan interference.

The incident involving Spencer Steer and the young fan highlights the need for fan education and awareness of the rules and boundaries within a baseball game. While it may be exciting for fans to catch a foul ball or be close to the action, it is essential to respect the players and the integrity of the game.

This incident is not an isolated case. There have been numerous instances of fan injuries caused by foul balls during baseball games. Albert Almora Jr. struck a 2-year-old girl with a foul ball, fracturing her skull. A 79-year-old woman died after being hit by a foul ball at Dodger Stadium. These incidents have reignited the debate about extending protective netting at baseball stadiums.

Players and fans are calling for increased safety precautions to prevent further injuries. Conditions at games have changed, with baseballs being hit harder than ever before and spectators being closer to the action. Physics professor John Eric Goff believes that the current netting is insufficient in protecting fans from foul balls. Victims like Dina Simpson, who was injured at a minor league game and has permanent vision loss, emphasize the urgent need for improved safety measures.

MLB teams have taken steps to address this issue by extending netting around home plate. However, resistance to further netting extensions remains. The White Sox are currently the only team with pole-to-pole netting, providing maximum protection for their fans.

Discussions about netting extensions are expected to happen in the off-season. The league and teams must prioritize fan safety while also considering the fan experience. Striking a balance between these two aspects will be crucial in protecting both the integrity of the game and the wellbeing of the fans.

In conclusion, the incident involving Spencer Steer and the young fan raises important questions about fan interference and the integrity of the game. Baseball must address these concerns and take proactive measures to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all fans. By implementing adequate netting and educating fans about proper behavior at games, the sport can continue to thrive while preserving its core values.
