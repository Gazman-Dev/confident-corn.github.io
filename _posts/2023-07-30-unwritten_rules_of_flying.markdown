Flying can sometimes be a stressful experience, but former Delta flight attendant Natalie Rader is here to share her unwritten rules of flying to help passengers have a better flight experience.

Stick to the luggage rules

One of the most important rules to follow when flying is to adhere to the luggage rules. This includes both the size and weight restrictions for carry-on bags as well as the regulations for checked luggage. By following these rules, you not only ensure a smoother boarding process but also help to maintain the safety and comfort of all passengers.

Wear your shoes in the lavatory

Another important rule to remember is to always wear your shoes when using the lavatory. This simple act of hygiene shows respect for other passengers and helps to keep the lavatory clean for everyone's use. So, no matter how tempting it may be to slip off your shoes during a long flight, remember to keep them on when visiting the lavatory.

Be mindful of smelly socks

We all understand that flying can be uncomfortable at times, but it's important to be mindful of your fellow passengers. One way to do this is by avoiding the temptation to take off your shoes and letting your smelly socks fill the cabin. This small consideration can make a big difference in the overall comfort of everyone on board.

Don't recline your seat during meal service

During meal service, it's common courtesy not to recline your seat. This allows the passenger behind you to enjoy their meal without feeling cramped or having their tray table disturbed. So, whether you're enjoying a delicious in-flight meal or a simple snack, remember to keep your seat in the upright position until the meal service is over.

Make sure your children have their own earbuds

If you're traveling with children, it's important to ensure that they have their own earbuds. This not only allows them to enjoy movies or music without disturbing other passengers but also helps to prevent the spread of germs. By providing each child with their own set of earbuds, you can help create a more enjoyable and hygienic environment for everyone on the flight.

Be kind

Finally, one of the most important unwritten rules of flying is to always be kind. Whether it's to the flight attendants, fellow passengers, or airport staff, a little kindness can go a long way. So, take a moment to smile, say please and thank you, and treat everyone with respect. By practicing kindness, you not only make your own flight experience more pleasant but also contribute to a positive and welcoming atmosphere for all.


In addition to these unwritten rules, there are also specific etiquette guidelines to follow when in a window seat. We asked Reddit users for their thoughts on proper window seat airplane bathroom etiquette and here's what they had to say:

- User's question about proper window seat airplane bathroom etiquette
- Responses from Reddit users on the topic
- Anecdote about a passenger who urinated in their pants instead of asking their seatmates to let them out
- Suggestions for proper etiquette when in a window seat
- Personal preference of selecting an aisle seat
- Courtesies to extend to seatmates when in a window seat

As you can see, there are various perspectives on this topic, but the general consensus is that communication is key. It's important to communicate with your seatmates if you need to use the bathroom so that they can make way for you. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable or unable to ask, it's better to alert a flight attendant who can assist you.

So, the next time you find yourself in a window seat, remember these unwritten rules and etiquette guidelines to ensure a smoother and more pleasant flight experience for everyone on board. Safe travels!
