A burning cargo ship loaded with thousands of cars is being towed to a temporary anchorage location off the northern Dutch coast. The smoke from the ship initially hampered the towing operation, but it has now subsided considerably.

Salvage crews started towing the burning cargo ship. The smoke from the ship subsided, allowing for the towing operation to proceed smoothly. The ship is now being towed to a temporary anchor point off the Dutch coast.

Experts are closely monitoring the ship's stability during the towing process. It is crucial to ensure the safety and security of the ship and its cargo.

To prevent any potential oil spill, a specialized boat is stationed nearby to clean up the area in case of an accident.

The destination of the ship is yet to be determined. The authorities are evaluating the options and considering the best course of action.

In related news, a separate fire incident occurred on the vehicle carrying ship Fremantle Highway in the North Sea. This ship was carrying 23 crew members and more than 3,000 cars. The fire is believed to have been sparked by one of the 500 electric vehicles onboard. The crew members were evacuated at sea with the help of boats and helicopters, but unfortunately, one person has died as a result of the fire.

The Fremantle Highway has been successfully towed to safety. The cargo onboard included 498 battery electric vehicles, including cars from prestigious brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Gallagher Marine Systems, a company hired by the vessel's owner, is actively monitoring the water and air quality in the vicinity of the ship. Efforts are being made to contain and mitigate pollution.

Meanwhile, it is of utmost importance to ensure the stability of the ship. The ship is listing, awakening memories of a long-ago disaster in New York Harbor involving the Normandie, which capsized after a spectacular fire. Salvage experts from Donjon Marine are working tirelessly to bring the Fremantle Highway back to an even keel.

Firefighters are continuing to battle the blaze on the ship. Multiple streams of water are being directed onto the deck of the Grande Costa d'Avorio, as thick, dark smoke billows from the top decks. The damaged areas on the ship's exterior are releasing water into the sea, creating a murky waterfall effect.

The legal principles of salvage are essential in situations like these. Salvage laws vary from one country to another, but they generally require the salvor to act voluntarily and successfully recover the property in peril. The salvor is then entitled to a reward commensurate with the value of the saved property.

Maritime law recognizes the risks salvors take to help others at sea. It allows for claims of salvage and provides a framework for determining the appropriate reward. In addition to property salvage, liability salvage rewards efforts to prevent or minimize environmental damage.

Salvage claims can be brought to Admiralty Courts and are enforceable in personam and in rem. The salvaged property attracts a maritime lien to secure payment for the salvor.

There is a two-year time limit to commence legal proceedings for salvage claims, starting from the date when the salvage operations conclude.
