## How has the commercial production and distribution of Agege bread in Kumba affected the local economy?
The commercial production and distribution of Agege bread in Kumba has had a significant impact on the local economy. Firstly, it has provided employment opportunities for the local population, both in the bakery itself and in supporting industries such as transportation and packaging. This has helped to reduce unemployment and improve the standard of living in the area. Additionally, the increased demand for Agege bread has led to an increase in the demand for wheat, which has benefited wheat farmers in Nigeria. They have been able to sell their wheat at higher prices, resulting in increased income and investment in their farms. This has helped to boost the agricultural sector and contribute to overall economic growth in the country. Finally, the commercial production and distribution of Agege bread has also created opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Many people have started their own Agege bread stalls or shops, which has stimulated local entrepreneurship and contributed to the growth of the informal sector. Overall, the commercial production and distribution of Agege bread in Kumba has had a positive impact on the local economy by creating employment, boosting the agricultural sector, and stimulating entrepreneurship.

## What impact does the high demand for Agege bread have on the availability and affordability of wheat in Nigeria?
The high demand for Agege bread has had a significant impact on the availability and affordability of wheat in Nigeria. As the demand for Agege bread has increased, so has the demand for wheat, since wheat is the main ingredient used to make the bread. This has put pressure on wheat supplies in Nigeria, as the country's domestic wheat production is inadequate to meet the demand. As a result, Nigeria has had to rely on imports to meet the shortfall. In 2017 and 2018, Nigeria imported wheat valued at about $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. This has led to increased costs for wheat imports, which are passed on to the consumers in the form of higher bread prices. The high demand for Agege bread has also led to an increase in the price of wheat locally, as suppliers are able to charge higher prices due to the strong demand. This has made wheat-based products less affordable for the average Nigerian consumer. As a result, some consumers may have to reduce their consumption of Agege bread or switch to alternative, more affordable bread options. Overall, the high demand for Agege bread has put pressure on the availability and affordability of wheat in Nigeria, leading to increased costs for bread and potentially affecting the food security of the population.

## What role do middlemen and re-sellers play in the distribution of bread in Nigeria, and how does it affect consumers?
Middlemen and re-sellers play a crucial role in the distribution of bread in Nigeria, including Agege bread. They act as intermediaries between the bakery and the consumer, ensuring that the bread reaches its intended market. Middlemen and re-sellers are responsible for transporting the bread from the bakery to various distribution points, such as local markets and supermarkets. They also help to promote and market the bread to potential customers, using their knowledge of the local market and consumer preferences. Additionally, middlemen and re-sellers often buy the bread in bulk from the bakery and then sell it in smaller quantities to individual consumers. This allows them to earn a profit margin on each sale. However, the involvement of middlemen and re-sellers in the distribution of bread can also have negative effects on consumers. For example, they may mark up the price of the bread, leading to higher prices for consumers. They may also engage in unfair business practices, such as hoarding or price manipulation, which can further increase the prices of bread. Additionally, the reliance on middlemen and re-sellers can add an extra layer of complexity to the distribution process, potentially leading to delays or inefficiencies. Overall, while middlemen and re-sellers play a crucial role in the distribution of bread in Nigeria, their involvement can have both positive and negative effects on consumers.
