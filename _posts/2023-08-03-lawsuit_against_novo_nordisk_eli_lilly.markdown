A personal injury law firm has filed a lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly over claims that their diabetes drugs, Ozempic and Mounjaro, can cause gastroparesis. The first case filed involves a 44-year-old woman who has experienced severe problems after taking both drugs. The law firm is investigating 400 other inquiries from clients across the United States.

Gastroparesis is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. While delayed gastric emptying is relatively common in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, a diagnosis of gastroparesis requires both delayed gastric emptying and moderate to severe digestive symptoms. People with diabetes are at increased risk for gastroparesis—a digestive disorder that can cause severe symptoms and affect quality of life.

In addition to their use in controlling blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro and Ozempic have been associated with significant weight loss. However, gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and diarrhea are common with both drugs. Mounjaro, a dual-acting GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, has not yet received approval for lowering the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The lawsuit claims that Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly failed to adequately warn about the potential side effects of their drugs. Both companies state that they prioritize patient safety and monitor and report safety information for their medicines. It is important for healthcare professionals to ask people with diabetes about digestive symptoms that may be indicative of gastroparesis.

The cost of Mounjaro ranges from about $1086 to higher depending on the dosage, while the cost of Ozempic ranges from about $995 to higher depending on the dosage. Insurance, discount coupons, copay cards, and financial assistance may help lower the cost of these medicines.

It is essential to note that the arrival of truly effective weight loss drugs has generated concerns among doctors, psychologists, and eating disorder experts. The long-term effects of these medications and the potential psychological toll of weight regain are areas of concern. Weight loss medications may not necessarily improve overall health outcomes, and exercise and healthy eating remain necessary for health benefits.

The influence of pharmaceutical companies on doctors and education is another area of concern, as it may reinforce the idea that a certain body mass index equals health. Moreover, weight loss drugs are not a solution on their own, as the human body is resistant to weight loss and tends to regain lost weight. Weight cycling, or the process of repeatedly losing and gaining weight, may also have negative health effects.

The marketing of weight loss drugs to children is concerning, as it raises questions about the impact on their developing bodies. Additionally, dieting and weight loss can contribute to the development of eating disorders, highlighting the need for a change in societal attitudes about weight and stigma.

Healthcare professionals have mixed opinions on the long-term effectiveness and risks of weight loss drugs. Some argue that weight loss medications may not be worth the potential risks and costs, while others believe they can be a valuable tool in certain cases. Individuals considering weight loss medications should carefully examine their reasons for wanting to lose weight and consult with healthcare professionals to make an informed decision.

As the lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly progresses, it is crucial to continue research and develop new treatments for gastroparesis in people with diabetes. The goal is to improve the management of symptoms and enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition.
