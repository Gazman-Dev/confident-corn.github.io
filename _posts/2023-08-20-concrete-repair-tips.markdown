Concrete repairs often fail because there is no bond between the layers of concrete. To ensure a strong and long-lasting repair, it is important to create a bond between the layers of concrete using a cement paint.

Cement paint acts as a bonding agent between layers of concrete. By applying a coating of bonding agent to the area in need of repair before applying fresh concrete, you can improve the durability and longevity of the repair.

Proper preparation of the area is crucial before bonding concrete. This includes thoroughly cleaning and removing any substances that may prevent bonding. It is also important to choose a paint specifically formulated for use on concrete. Consider using DRYLOK® Latex Concrete Floor Paint or DRYLOK® E1 Latex 1-Part Epoxy Concrete Floor Paint for a showroom-quality finish.

When applying the paint, it is recommended to apply the first coat and allow it to dry thoroughly before applying the second coat. Removing any imperfections from the concrete surface before applying the second coat can help achieve a seamless and smooth finish. Additionally, applying the second coat in the opposite direction of the first coat can enhance the bonding effect.

After painting, it is essential to let the concrete surface dry thoroughly for at least a few days to ensure proper curing. Using high-quality masonry preparation products from DRYLOK® can further enhance the bonding effect.

While cement paint is a great option for concrete repairs, it is important to note the advantages and disadvantages of using it. Additionally, it is crucial to be aware of common mistakes to avoid when bonding concrete to ensure the best results.

In the article, a specific concrete repair product called Phoscrete is mentioned as a recommended option due to its benefits and availability. Phoscrete is DOT approved for use by 25 US States and is known for its strong bonding properties and fast installation.
