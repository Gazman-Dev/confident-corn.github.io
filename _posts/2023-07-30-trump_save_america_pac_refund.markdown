Former President Donald Trump's Save America PAC has requested a refund of $60 million it had given to another political action committee.

Save America PAC has been used by Trump to pay for his legal bills, which have amounted to $40 million this year. The PAC had spent $16 million on legal fees in 2021 and 2022 combined.

Trump is currently facing multiple indictments, including charges of falsifying business records in New York and mishandling of classified documents in Florida. There are also ongoing investigations into the January 6th insurrection and Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.

Due to these legal challenges, Trump is having difficulty finding lawyers to defend him in the January 6th investigation. He does not have a legal defense fund and has expressed that only the guilty establish such funds.

However, Trump has stated that he would use his own money for his campaign if necessary.

This recent request for a refund indicates possible financial strain on Trump's side as he continues to grapple with legal hurdles and mounting legal expenses.

It remains to be seen if the refund request will be granted and how it could potentially impact Trump's future legal defense and political endeavors.
