Swiss police reported that the remains of a climber missing for 37 years have been found on a melting glacier near the Matterhorn. Mountaineers came across the remains and scattered climbing gear, including a boot, on the Theodul glacier above Zermatt. DNA testing confirmed the remains to belong to a German climber who went missing in September 1986. This discovery highlights the impact of climate change on glaciers and the uncovering of historical mysteries. Receding glaciers in the region have been exposing the remains of long-missing climbers and mountaineers.

The Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps is experiencing rockfalls, landslides, and other dangerous conditions due to melting permafrost and snow. The stiffness of the mountain decreases and the ground sediments become soggy and wobbly with water in summer. Cracks on the mountain expand and move, leading to the breaking off of surface pieces. Switzerland is projected to have a climate like Mediterranean countries by 2060. The 1,500 glaciers in Switzerland have lost 60 percent of their volume since 1850. Climate change is imperiling mountaineering, with mountaineering routes being impacted and some no longer existing.

Mountaineering routes on the Matterhorn have crumbled away and trails are no longer accessible. Scientists are tracking the changing terrain of the Matterhorn using 50 sensors installed on the mountain. The sensors will allow them to alert mountain guides to instabilities and dangers. The Matterhorn is not in danger of toppling or crumbling, but climbing conditions have become more dangerous.
