Undisputed junior lightweight champion Alycia Baumgardner has tested positive for two banned substances during a voluntary anti-doping test leading into her July 15 fight against Christina Linardatou. Baumgardner's test revealed the presence of mesterolone and methenolone acetate metabolites in her pre-fight 'A' sample. However, subsequent tests after the fight came back clean.

Baumgardner vehemently denies ever using these substances and claims to have never heard of them. Matchroom Boxing, her promoter, defers to regulatory authorities for further action and investigation.

The World Boxing Council (WBC) has also launched an investigation into the test findings. This latest development has sparked a call for standardized testing in boxing by Linardatou's promoter, highlighting the importance of maintaining a level playing field for all competitors.

This incident isn't the first for Matchroom Boxing, as Dillian Whyte, another fighter under their promotion, also tested positive for banned substances earlier this month. The increasing number of positive tests raises concerns and reinforces the need for stricter anti-doping measures in the sport.

In connection with this news, let's delve deeper into the context surrounding one of the banned substances found in Baumgardner's system - metenolone acetate.

Metenolone acetate, introduced for medical use in 1961 for treating anemia due to bone marrow failure, has gained popularity outside the medical field for its performance-enhancing effects on physique and athletic performance. The drug is classified as a controlled substance in many countries.

Despite its potential benefits, metenolone acetate has limited availability, making its use less common compared to other banned substances. It is worth noting that metenolone acetate does not have estrogenic effects or pose a significant risk of liver damage, unlike some other performance-enhancing drugs.

While the use of metenolone acetate can lead to desirable physical effects, it is not without its risks. Side effects of the drug include masculinization symptoms such as deepening voice, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement in women. Additionally, metenolone enanthate, a related drug administered via injection into the muscle, is also used by some athletes for similar enhancement purposes.

Effective anti-doping practices in boxing are crucial in order to preserve the integrity of the sport. Organizations like the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) strive to promote fairness in combat sports through unannounced drug testing and maintaining transparency with test results.

VADA not only conducts testing but also plays a significant role in educating athletes, commissions, trainers, and the public about the dangers of performance-enhancing drug (PED) use. They provide information on safe and PED-free supplements, as well as offering confidential counseling and referral services for athletes at risk of PED use.

The investigation into Alycia Baumgardner's positive test emphasizes the need for all stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, promoters, and athletes, to work together towards a cleaner and fairer competitive landscape in boxing.
