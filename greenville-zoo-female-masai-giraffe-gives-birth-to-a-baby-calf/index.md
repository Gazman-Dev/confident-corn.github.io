## AI predict: Autumn's baby calf is a significant achievement for the Greenville Zoo's Species Survival Program
The Greenville Zoo's Species Survival Program will continue to thrive, and the number of endangered animals will increase, thanks to the successful birth of Autumn's baby calf. Greenville Zoo will receive more funding from the government to increase their efforts in protecting and preserving endangered species. In the near future, we will see an increase in the population of endangered species, and this will be a significant achievement for the Greenville Zoo and the Species Survival Program.
